            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>He that goeth beſides the rule of faith (which is the Catholique Church) doth not come in the way, but goeth out of the way:</hi> wherein you have added theſe words of your owne (viz.) <hi>which is the Catholique Church,</hi> in the ſame character with S. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and in lieu of Scripture you pretend the Church to be the rule of Faith; whereas that ancient Father aſſures us,<note place="margin">Civitas Dei credit Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris—Undè fides ipſa concepta eſt, ex quâ ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus vivit.

                  <hi>arrowes, even bitter words,</hi> into your owne boſome, would it not ſhew rather want of matter than proofe of doctrine? If you <hi>delight to ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornefull,</hi> it ſhall be my comfort to tread in the ſteps of my Saviour, <hi>who when hee was reviled, reviled not againe.</hi> To let paſſe your bitter reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of my learning and breeding, I will come to the matter.</p>
               <p>You have not ſtated the queſtion (ſay you) <hi>fully and truly, for you were to ſhew the viſibilitie of the Church by perſons in all ages.</hi> Then you demand of me where the Church was, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>the houſe of God, and pillar of truth;</hi> and thus you preſcribe mee my weapons, and teach mee how to fight.</p>
               <p>Touching the viſibilitie of the Church, it is not to be confined within the narrow compaſſe of an Epiſtle; and therefore I will anſwer you and your Jeſuites challenge at large in place convenient: and as touching your demand where the Church was, which is called <hi>the pillar of truth,</hi> I anſwer in briefe, not in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in <hi>Epheſus;</hi> for otherwiſe it might ſeeme incongruous, that the Apoſtle ſhould exhort <hi>Timothy</hi> to walke circumſpectly in the Church of God, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the pillar and firmament of truth. And therefore the <hi>Turke</hi> may better alledge this place to prove <hi>Mah mets</hi> religion, being now ſubject to his power, than you to juſtifie the Romiſh religion, becauſe <hi>Epheſus</hi> was the pillar of truth.</p>
               <p>You proceed, and by way of prevention you tell
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154277:13"/>me <hi>the controverſie is not ſo much of the doctrine as of the perſons:</hi> and then you conclude ſimply in the very ſame page, <hi>The queſtion is not of the doctrine, but of the perſons. Oportet eſſe memorem:</hi> I will but let you ſee your contradiction, I quarrell it not, onely I pray you tell mee in the words of ſoberneſſe and truth, did ever any wiſe man (except your ſelfe) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove the true Church by the viſibilitie of the perſons? May not <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Heretiques</hi> by the ſame reaſon claime a true Church, becauſe they had viſible perſons in all ages?</p>
               <p>But ſay you this hath beene the way which the holy Fathers have taken, either in proving the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith, or diſproving of hereſies; and for your Aſſertion, you cite <hi>Tertullian, Irenaeus, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Optatus</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> give me leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your Authors, for as yet you have produced but one ancient Father, and him you have falſified in the <hi>Frontiſpice</hi> of your booke.</p>

                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> (in the firſt place cited by you) hee demonſtrates two wayes how to diſcerne the Church: firſt, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Apoſtle or Apoſtolicall perſon to have founded it; next, by the conformity of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the Apoſtles: and in his third book againſt <hi>Marcion</hi> (which is your ſecond citation) hee hath nothing at all for your purpoſe.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> hee is expreſſely againſt you; for in the firſt chapter and third booke (cited by you) he ſaith, <hi>By the will of God they have delivered the Goſpel to bee the pillar
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154277:13"/>and foundation of truth.</hi> In the ſecond hee ſaith, that <hi>when Heretiques are convinced by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they fall to accuſe them, as if they were not right, or of authoritie, and that they are ambiguous and doubtfull.</hi> In the third hee proveth the truth of the Church by the conformitie of doctrine to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, not by the viſibilitie, as you pretend. In his fourth booke cited by you, he ſhewes that bare ſucceſſion is no note of the Church; and in his 45. chapter, which you quote, there is nothing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for your queſtion. And laſtly, in the 46. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he proveth that the New Teſtament is as ſevere againſt fornication as the Old, or rather more: and this may touch the free-hold of that Church which diſpenſeth with <hi>Stewes;</hi> but of the point in queſtion he ſpeakes nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Now put on your Spectacles, and take a review of your Authors. The firſt maketh nothing for you, the ſecond is expreſſely againſt you, the third ſpeakes not to the point in queſtion, the fourth and fifth handle the queſtion, but not at all to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or our prejudice: and thus you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced foureteene ſeverall places out of the ancient Fathers in one page, and all either impertinently, or falſly, or directly againſt your ſelfe: by which the Reader may conjecture what is like to bee the iſſue of your whole worke, who have ſo groſſely falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſo many authorities in your Epiſtle, and before the entrance into the body of your booke.</p>
               <p>From your lame proofes of the Churches authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, you proceed to the juſtification of your maimed commandements, <hi>viz.</hi> in leaving out the ſecond, and altering the fourth in your <hi>Breviaries</hi> and <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> You ſay <hi>you print them in your Bibles, and therefore they are not abſolutely left out, as long as they are elſewhere: Mute quod ſcimus.</hi> It is true the words are contained in your Bibles. But <hi>Dic quod rogamus,</hi> why doe you not publiſh Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements as hee wrote them? Admit that in your <hi>Catechiſmes</hi> you ſhould ſet downe this forme of <hi>Baptiſme, I baptize thee in the name of the Father,</hi> and leave out the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> would it be ſufficient to ſay it is not abſolutely left out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contained in the Bible? Shew mee the man amongſt your Papalins that dare alter a Kings command or a Popes Breve, and will your Church attempt more againſt the Precepts of God, than
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154277:15"/>againſt a Popes Bull or a Kings Proclamation? But the truth is, and you know it too well, if the ſecond precept were expreſſely ſet downe in your <hi>Pſalters,</hi> the common people would be too buſie in expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the cauſe why Image-worſhip ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Church, and yet condemned by Gods word.</p>
               <p>Yea, but <hi>it is part of the firſt commandement</hi> (ſay you) <hi>or otherwiſe it is ceremoniall.</hi>

The truth is, it is not ceremoniall, but morall, and plainly diſtinct from the former; for the firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the true worſhip of any falſe god, the ſecond forbids any falſe worſhip of the true God; and howſoever <hi>Pereſius</hi> and <hi>Catharinus,</hi> and you for company, would have gladly the Law againſt Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be poſitive and ceremoniall, and ſo to ceaſe at the comming of Chriſt; yet your owne <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> diſavowes it with a <hi>Non probatur:</hi>

Your learning haply may worke miracles in the eares of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned that cannot judge; but it cannot turne dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into light, nor errour into truth. And although your bitterneſſe might juſtly occaſion that malice, of which you accuſe me; yet it is ſo farre from my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154277:17"/>thoughts, that I pitie you, and in requitall of your paines, I pray for you: and that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>

                  </note> I wiſh to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and members of your Church, <hi>Brethren, my hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and prayer to God is that they may be ſaved.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>theſe were not your firſt fruits, for you tranſlated and publiſhed</hi> Bertram, <hi>an obſcure Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, with a preface of your owne, and thereby gave ſufficient triall of your ignorance and corruption, whereof you were convinced by</hi> (O.E.) <hi>but never clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your ſelfe of ſo foule a taxe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true that ſome ten yeeres ſince I cauſed <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> to be reprinted, and publiſhed with a preface before it; and it is as true, that hee being a Romiſh Prieſt taught our doctrine of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> above eight hundred yeeres ſince, and therefore by way of prevention, you terme him <hi>an obſcure Author,</hi> though he were famous in his time.</p>
               <p>As touching the foule taxe of ignorance and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in falſe tranſlating it (wherewith you charge mee) you are much miſtaken; for I never tranſlated it, but onely reprinted the old tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this both hee and you might have ſeene in the <hi>Frontiſpice</hi> of the booke, in theſe words: <hi>Tranſlated and imprinted in the Engliſh tongue, Anno Dom.</hi> 1549. <hi>and now the third time publiſhed:</hi> ſo that the Tranſlation into Engliſh was made before I was borne. Againe, in the end of my preface you ſhall finde theſe words, <hi>Pittie it were but this lamp ſhould receive a new light by reprinting him, which the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the time had almoſt extinquiſhed.</hi> Now I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154277:17"/>pray, Sir, what cauſe was there of any anſwer to your nameleſſe Author, or rather what cauſe was there of his and your bitterneſſe, in charging mee with falſe tranſlating, with ignorance and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I profeſſe I am not ignorant that your men are guiltie of many ſuch falſe accuſations <hi>(ad faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum populum)</hi> to make your Proſelytes beleeve, that all our bookes are full of lyes; of whom I may truly ſay, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſometimes ſpake of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts, When they cannot by ſlie and wily coſenage creep like Aſpes, with open profeſſed violence they rage like Lions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly (you ſay) that <hi>an Anſwer to my booke hath hitherto beene deferred, becauſe no man of learning would thinke it worth his paines to make any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let mee tell you, I have received three printed anſwers to <hi>Via tuta,</hi> beſides two written copies from nameleſſe Authors: the firſt was from a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and that is called <hi>Via verè tuta:</hi> the ſecond from a Prieſt, and that is called <hi>A paire of Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to ſee the way:</hi> the third is from a Clerk, and that is termed <hi>A Whetſtone of Reproofe.</hi> The firſt printed Author is termed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>John Heigham,</hi> whoſe Treatiſe ſavours too much of blaſphemie and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldrie: the ſecond is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>John Floyd,</hi> whoſe worke is full of bitterneſſe and ſubtiltie: the third is <hi>Tom Tell troth</hi> (for ſo he termes himſelfe) whoſe pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet is fraught with all childiſhneſſe and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie. Now if none of theſe were men of learning, as you confeſſe (becauſe no learned man would take the paines to anſwer it) what may I thinke of your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154277:18"/>wiſdome, which hath returned an anſwer full of railing accuſations (ſuch as the <hi>Angell</hi> of God would not have brought againſt the Devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe)? I ſay, in regard your bitter lines are rather a libell without a name, than a Chriſtian and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate confutation, I might well have declined a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to it, and have told you with S. <hi>Jerome, Your bitterneſſe deſerves rather an anſwer with ſcorn,</hi>

               <p>For a concluſion take but a ſhort view of your bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproaches: you term me a <hi>blind Guide,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall Knight;</hi> you ſay <hi>my booke is a Labyrinth of errours;</hi> you crie out <hi>my ſirname hath the two firſt letters of a lye;</hi> you ſay <hi>the title of Sir will be left for me;</hi> you condemne me of <hi>execrable perjurie;</hi> you affirme <hi>I am a framer of lyes,</hi> and <hi>abound in all kind of falſhood;</hi> you tell me, <hi>I ſcarce underſtand Latine,</hi> and it is conceived a <hi>Miniſter made my booke;</hi> you charge me with <hi>obſtinacie,</hi> with <hi>malice,</hi> with <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> with <hi>ignorance,</hi> with <hi>falſe tranſlating;</hi> you proclaime the fearefull <hi>judgements</hi> of God upon me for <hi>perverting ſoules,</hi> and as if I were paſt all grace, you ſay <hi>I am not capable of any good advice;</hi> yet at laſt (as if you would make mee ſome amends

               </p>
               <p>Surely you have ſaid enough, and you doe well to forbeare to ſay more; for I thinke the words of your Epiſtle are ſo ſufficiently dipt in lye and gall, that they will ſerve for your whole worke: but I pardon you, and ſhall returne you no other anſwer than the Arch-Angell gave to <hi>Satan,</hi>

And that you may know our Articles are not new, nor newly coyned by our men; if you will put on your ſpectacles, you ſhall finde that moſt of our prime <hi>Articles</hi> are taught and received by your owne Church, as well as ours; and therefore I hope you will confeſſe they are not coyned, and built upon the foundation of a new Church.</p>
                  <p>Briefly touching our 39. <hi>Articles.</hi> The firſt ſort are in the Affirmative, both ours and yours; and all thoſe are uniformely received by both Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The ſecond ſort are ours onely, which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and you deny: and thoſe are very few in number, and are evidently deduced from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The third ſort are yours, which we deny, and you affirme; and for that cauſe you terme our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion negative; and thoſe remaine for you to make good. Joyne therefore thoſe negative <hi>Articles,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:154277:27"/>which are wholly yours, to thoſe poſitive <hi>Articles</hi> which you hold with us, and you ſhall eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne (if the denomination followeth the greater part) thoſe <hi>Articles</hi> may moſt properly bee termed <hi>Articles</hi> of your faith; for I dare confidently avow that of the 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> there are above 35. yours, that is, either ſuch which you hold with us, which are at leaſt twentie, or ſuch wherein the affirmative is yours, and not ours, which are at leaſt fifteene: take therefore your owne libertie, either confute ours, or make good your owne, <hi>&amp; herbam porri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemus,</hi> and I will give you the bucklers.</p>
                  <p>You proceed, and upon a falſe ſuppoſall, that our Church hath created new Articles, you proclaime in the name of your owne Church theſe words: <hi>We teach that for Articles of faith, the Church can make none, as ſhe cannot write a Canonicall booke of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaw a ſuppoſed Baſtard caſting ſtones in a preſſe of much people, he gave the boy this caveat: <hi>Take heed leſt thou hit thy father.</hi> This is like to bee your caſe; for by this <hi>Tenet</hi> you will wound the Church your <hi>Mother,</hi> and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers you will ſurely hit your holy <hi>Father</hi> the Pope.</p>
                  <p>It appeares firſt, that you endevoured to ſhew, that your Church hath created no new Articles of faith, but for want of ſolid proofes you begin to faint, and thinke it the ſafeſt way to turne Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in this point, and ſay, <hi>the Church can create none:</hi> but I wonder how you dare pronounce in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154277:27"/>the name of the Church <hi>(we teach)</hi> whereas in truth your Church teacheth it not. This is therefore but a cunning device of yours, to dazle the eyes of the ignorant with your falſe glaſſes, and to make them beleeve it is the generall <hi>Tenet</hi> of your Church; and then you thinke they will conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Aſſertion: <hi>Ergo, The Church hath created none;</hi> when as your ſaying makes more ſtrongly againſt you, if either your Articles prove new, or the Pope and his Agents profeſſe the contrarie.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:154277:28"/>catholique:</hi> and this hee proves directly from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councels. And whereas you affirme, that your Church can no more make an article of faith, than ſhee can make a Canonicall Booke of Scripture;<note place="margin">Canus loc.

                  <p>Thus farre I have waded in your behalfe, that you may the better juſtifie your owne Aſſertion; for you wil find your Church is like a houſe divided againſt it ſelfe (and therefore cannot ſtand long). I ſay that <hi>Quere</hi> which was made in <hi>Waldens</hi> dayes, was reſolved above two hundred yeares before by your profound Schoole-man <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> in your Churches behalfe, that the Pope had power <hi>Condere articulos fidei,</hi> to create new articles of faith; to remove therefore theſe fig-leaves with which you would cover the naked truth: This learned Doctour well underſtood that there were many new articles of religion crept into the Church in his dayes; he knew well, that (albeit he were the prime Schoole man of his time) yet with all his ſophiſtrie hee could not make them comply with the ancient Catholique faith: and thereupon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:154277:28"/>he thought it the ſureſt way, to give the Pope an abſolute and independant power over faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and accordingly reſolved,<note place="margin">Ad ſolam au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem ſummi Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis pertinet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Editio Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli, ſicut &amp; alia omnia quae pertinent ad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam Eccleſiam.

                  <p>I will not take advantage of your firſt Aſſertion, that your faith is grounded upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles (which you can never prove;) but wil joyne iſſue with you upon your laſt <hi>Aſſumpſit, That is only to be called a new faith, which is cleane of another kind, and is different &amp; diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what was taught before:</hi> but ſuch are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Articles of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> as ſhall appeare by proofes at large in their proper places. In the meane time let me tell you, your Church teacheth not onely <hi>Novê,</hi> but <hi>Nova,</hi> not onely <hi>Praeter,</hi> but <hi>Contra,</hi> even beſides, and contrarie to that which ſhe firſt received from the ancient Church: ſo that howſoever you ſeeke to darken truth by faire and ſpecious pretences, yet in truth your <hi>Trent</hi> Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are forraine to the faith, as neither principles nor concluſions of it. And that you may know and acknowledge with us, that your <hi>Trent</hi> faith is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and diſagreeing from what was taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I pray call to mind your owne confeſſions touching theſe particular Articles of your Roman Church.</p>
                  <p>Your doctrine touching Lay-peoples communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating under one kind (namely in bread onely) is an Article of the <hi>Roman</hi> faith, and now generally taught and practiſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: but this practice, by your owne confeſſion, is different and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154277:30"/>diſagreeing from what was taught before: for you ſay, pag. 253. touching the Authors which you bring for proofe, <hi>That it was the common practice of the Church, for the Laytie to communicate in both kinds.</hi> I allow of their authoritie.</p>
                  <p>Your Prayer and Service in an unknown tongue, as it is now uſed in the Roman Church, by your owne confeſſion is different and diſagreeing from what was taught before; for, ſay you pag. 270. <hi>It is true,</hi> that <hi>Prayer and Service in the vulgar tongue was uſed in the firſt and beſt ages, according to the precept of the Apoſtles, and practice of the Fathers.</hi> In the beginning it was ſo.</p>
                  <p>Your doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which at this day is generally received, <hi>de ſubſtantia fidei,</hi> for an Article of Faith, yet by your owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is different and diſagreeing from what was taught before; for, ſay you pag. 167. <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation might well be ſaid not to have beene, de ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia fidei, in the Primitive Church, (as Yribarne ſpeaketh) becauſe it had not beene ſo plainly delivered nor determined in any Councell, till Gregorie the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth his time:</hi> and this was above a thouſand yeares after Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Your private or ſolitarie Maſſe, wherein the Prieſts doe daily communicate without the people, is by your own confeſſion different and diſagreeing from what was taught before and practiſed; for, ſay you pag. 191. <hi>They ſay</hi> (ſpeaking of divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) <hi>it was the practice of the Primitive Church to communicate everie day with the Prieſt.</hi> I grant it.</p>

                  <p>Theſe points of controverſie, which are ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly purſued by your men againſt the members of our Church, the ſtrength and force of truth hath extorted from you, and therefore I may truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Exore tuo,</hi> from your owne confeſſion, that your <hi>Trent</hi> faith is new, becauſe it is different and diſagreeing from what was taught before.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154277:42"/>and firſt touching the ſacred <hi>Bible</hi> which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Bible</hi> (ſay you) <hi>is not ſo forbidden, but that it is in the Biſhops power to grant leave, if upon Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Pariſh Prieſt or Confeſſor of the partie that deſireth leave, he finde him to be ſuch a one as may not incurre danger of faith, &amp;c. which with any reaſonable man may be counted ſufficient liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that by the fourth Rule of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, the <hi>Bible</hi> may be licenſed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, but the party muſt have the licenſe in writing: and withall it is decreed,<note place="margin">Regula <hi>4.</hi> in indice libr. prohibit. p. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note>

                     <hi>no new power was granted to the Biſhops, or Inquiſitors, or Superiors, to licenſe the buying, reading, or keeping the Bible in the vulgar tongue; ſeeing hitherto by the command and practiſe of the holy Inquiſition, the power of granting ſuch licenſes, to reade or keepe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the vulgar Language, or any part of Scripture, as well of the New as the Old Teſtament, or any ſums or Hyſtoricall Abridgement of the ſame in any vulgar
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154277:42"/>Language hath beene taken from them: Quod qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem inviolatè ſervandum eſt;</hi> and this is inviolably to be obſerved. You ſee then, that howſoever your <hi>Pius</hi> Pope gave a diſpenſation for the reading of the Scriptures: yet Pope <hi>Clement</hi> his Succeſſor, declared that licenſe to be void and of none effect; and that which concludes your Aſſertion for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, it was by him decreed, to bee kept without any diſpenſation or violation.<note place="margin">Inviolatè ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandum.</note>

                  <p>Thus touching the ſacred Bible you have ſeverall Tranſlations, upon ſeverall paines to be received, and both different each from other in many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places: you have ranked the ſacred Bible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Bookes prohibited; and laſtly, you ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly grant a licenſe for the Ignorant to reade the Scripture: and by another decree you abridge that licenſe ſo granted. I proceed from the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scriptures, to your purging and falſifying of the ancient Fathers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for Fathers</hi> (ſay you) <hi>it is moſt groſſely falſe which the Knight after the ordinary Miniſteriall tune, ſtands canting, that we blot out and raze them at our pleaſures. What is it then that theſe men would have? What is it they can carpe at? Nothing but that they themſelves are ſtung, in that hereby they are kept either from publiſhing their owne wicked workes, or corrupting the Fathers at their pleaſure; and to wipe away this blemiſh from themſelves, would lay it upon us.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemes you have beene well acquainted with Rogues and ſturdy Beggers, who have taught you
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154277:43"/>the Terme of <hi>(Canting)</hi> a word proper for ſuch kinde of people: but whereas you ſay it is groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe that you blot and raze the Fathers, and that therein we ſeeke to wipe away the blemiſh from our ſelves, and lay it upon you; for the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the truth, firſt, looke I pray upon the place where the corrupted Fathers were printed, &amp; ſee by whom they were licenſed; then heare your owne men witneſſing their owne confeſſion, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them; and laſtly, peruſe the places which I ſhall produce razed and corrupted, and then tell me if the Myſterie of Iniquity doth not cloſely worke in your <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and that the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are groſſely falſified, and notoriouſly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by your owne men, even in the principall points of Doctrine controverted betwixt us.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154277:44"/>Scriptures;</hi> and yet by the ſeverall Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your learned Writers, are adjudged to be all counterfeit: and without doubt, their leaden-ſtile, their deepe ſilence of Antiquity concerning them, the Scriptures alledged by them after St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> Tranſlation (being long before his time) doe eaſily convince them of falſhood. <hi>Antoninus Contius,</hi> the Kings Profeſſor of Law in the Univerſitie of <hi>Bruges,</hi> tells us that he brought many reaſons in his Preface,<note place="margin">An. <hi>1570.</hi>

                     <hi>The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor who was to overſee the printed Bookes, would not ſuffer it to paſſe, and what became of it he remembred not, nor knew how to procure it.</hi> Thus your men are not onely aſhamed to publiſh their Baſtard Epiſtles, and equall them to the Word of God, in behalfe of your new doctrine, but you cenſure alſo and purge your owne men for condemning ſuch lying inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Whether to forge a falſe deed, or to raze a true one, be the greater fault, it is not greatly materiall: for your owne men are guilty of both. And laſtly, when neither purging, nor falſifying will ſerve the turne (which you have practiſed in Bookes ſet out the firſt 800. yeares) you bring a Prohibition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Authors, Prieſts, and Profeſſors in the

And this muſt needes ſeeme very probable to all, becauſe they are corrupted chiefely in thoſe main Articles of Faith which make againſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:154277:59"/>your Church. The ancient Records and Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which you have had many hundred yeeres in your poſſeſsion, doe all witneſſe theſe forgeries and corruptions in the printed Fathers, and will you claime the Fathers for your Rule of Faith, when you make them ſpeake more like children than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Shall a Guardian to an infant, having poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of his Lands, and keeping his Deeds and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences during his minoritie, raze and falſifie them, and thereby intitle himſelfe to the Wards Lands, becauſe hee was ſome time poſſeſſed of them, and can produce forged Evidences for them? This is our very caſe: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her infancie was a faithfull Guardian of her childrens right, ſhee kept the Manuſcripts and the ancient Records of the Fathers, in that puritie as ſhe firſt received the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; after the Pope had made an univerſall Title and claime to all Catholike Churches, hee intruded into other mens Rights by forgerie and corruptions, he made the Fathers ſpeake according to the <hi>Trent</hi> decrees, in an unknowne tongue, and now by forged cavilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion detaines the poſſeſsion againſt the right own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But let me tell you, as the Kings Subject, you are lyable to puniſhment in ſuch caſes in temporall affaires.<note place="margin">See the title of Forger of falſe deeds fol. <hi>(mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi)</hi> 180. <hi>b.</hi>

                  <p>Thus much touching the razing and corrupting of the Fathers for the firſt 800. yeares. Now I proceed to your <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and blotting out the moderne Authours for the laſt 800. yeares.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foraſmuch</hi> (ſay you) <hi>as concerneth the late Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Authors of this laſt age, for this our Index (of which is al the difficultie) beginneth but from the yeere</hi> 1515. <hi>whatſoever needeth correction, is to bee amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or blotted out; yet for others going before that time, it is expreſly ſaid, that nothing may be changed, unleſſe ſome manifeſt errors, through the fraud of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, or careleſneſſe of the Printer, bee crept in:</hi> Thus you.</p>
                  <p>From your corrupting the ancient Councels and Fathers (which I have ſhowne) wee are at laſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154277:60"/>come to the correcting of moderne Authors; and as I have led you through an Hoſpitall of maimed Souldiers, ſo now I will ſend you to the houſe of correction, where I will leave you without Baile or Maine-prize, till you have cleared your ſelfe and your aſſociates, for wounding and cutting out the tongues, of your owne Authors, in ſpeaking truth againſt the corruptions of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But your correcting <hi>Index</hi> (ſay you) <hi>began but from the yeare</hi> 1515.<note place="margin">P. <hi>24.</hi> &amp; <hi>144.</hi>

And as touching your Aſſertion, that you purge the latter writers onely from the yeare 1515. and not beyond that time, this is moſt falſe, and you had ſaid more truly, if you had confeſſed that for 1515. yeares together, your Church ſpared no Authours,

The truth is, the words imprinted in the skirts and tables of your Bibles and Fathers,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154277:62"/>are thornes in your eyes, and goades in your ſides: and from hence we may eaſily diſcerne, why you leave out the ſecond Commandement, and alter the fourth in your <hi>Pſalters</hi> and <hi>Breviaries,</hi> which you dare not alter in your Bibles.

And as touching other Authors in the latter ages, you have gone beyond your Commiſſion, hundreds of years, in falſifying, corrupting, forbidding, and purging them; and this was long before your prefixed yeare of 1515.</p>

This <hi>deceivableneſſe</hi> of your <hi>unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> I have in part diſcovered. Now I come to your Authors of this laſt age (for I will cite none but your owne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) and therein lieth another myſterie not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the firſt; and that is this: your <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius</hi> was firſt proclaimed generally againſt all Heretickes (meaning the Proteſtants) but when
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154277:72"/>it comes to examination, it points eſpecially at the particular members of your owne Church; and that which is moſt remarkable, after that your <hi>Trent</hi> Councel had diſtinguiſhed with <hi>Anathema's</hi> her <hi>Roman</hi> faith from the faith of Proteſtants, after ſhe had forbidden and condemned by her <hi>Index</hi> divers of your owne Authors, as ſavouring of <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous</hi> doctrine; nay more, after ſhe had declared all to be Heretickes, and their Doctrine Hereticall, who would dare to teach or publiſh any contrary beliefe to that which was once eſtabliſhed by a Generall Councell; yet I ſay, the members of your owne Church, and thoſe not of the meaneſt ranke, both Biſhops and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, have delivered in print many points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine agreeable to the Articles of our Church; and yet you ſay they never left the Church, they are not perſonally to be noted nor ranked amongſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes; when for the very ſame Tenets we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, accurſed, forbidden, and utterly condemned as Heretickes and Reprobates: and thus the head of your Church being divided from the members, in points of ſaving faith, may ſay unto the <hi>tongue,</hi> I have no need of thee, and conſequently may cut it out. Howſoever, this uſe we may ſafely make of your <hi>Index,</hi> that if in after ages by new Impreſſions the true doctrine of Proteſtants ſhall be razed and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aboliſhed in your <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, yet your very <hi>Index</hi> will appeare as a ſtrong Evidence, to ſhew that ſuch doctrines were taught in former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and howſoever the faction in the Papacie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

Shall I make you my Confeſſor? I cannot chuſe but ſmile when I conſider what great paines you have taken in this whole Chapter, to uphold the Articles of your Faith with ſixe pretended rules, and all infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, as namely, Scripture in the plaine and literall ſenſe; Tradition or common beliefe and practice of the whole Church; Councels either generall or particular, confirmed by the See Apoſtolike; the authoritie of that whole See it ſelfe defining <hi>Ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra,</hi> though without either generall or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Councell; the common and uniforme conſent of ancient Fathers or moderne Doctours and Schoole-men, delivering any thing unto us as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith: All theſe ſixe rules (ſay you) <hi>we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and are ready to make good whatſoever is taught any of theſe wayes.</hi>

                  <p>When I ſay you aſſume confidently, that all theſe are infallible rules to leade men to the knowledge of your Faith, and at laſt you conclude, and as it were ſhut up all thoſe rules of knowledge, with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of an implicite faith. This I confeſſe is ſuch a myſtery of fooliſhneſſe, as deſerveth rather laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an anſwer.

                  <p>
                     <label>The Reply.</label> You have anſwered two Sections almoſt in two words; the firſt, in denying it to be to the purpoſe; the latter, in giving me the lye: And thus like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Caeſar</hi> you have briefly expreſſed the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your victory in few words,<note place="margin">Veni, vidi, vici.</note> 
                     <hi>I came, I ſaw, I overcame.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, you demand, <hi>what is this to the purpoſe of a viſible Church?</hi> But I rather wonder to what purpoſe you make ſuch a demand; For my Booke is entitled <hi>The Safe Way,</hi> not the viſibility of the Church. Yet let me tell you, the Authors which I cite are for the moſt part members of your Church, and their authorities tend much to the proofe of a viſible Church, if your <hi>Index Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorius</hi> did not ſpunge them, and cauſe their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be often inviſible. For inſtance; in our behalfe I cite <hi>Caſſander:</hi> To <hi>Caſſander</hi> you anſwer, <hi>he is like your ſelfe, an Hereticke, or next doore to them:</hi> and yet elſewhere you ſay, <hi>with much adoe he may paſſe for a Catholike.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. <hi>21.</hi> Oportet eſſe memorem.</note> I cite <hi>Cecenas</hi> Generall of the order of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> as witneſſing the viſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Church above 300. yeares agoe; you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>he was condemned for diſobedience and rebel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lion; for he ſaid Pope</hi> John <hi>the</hi> 22. <hi>was an Apoſtata

Now if you pleaſe, take a review of theſe Authors. <hi>Caſſander</hi> (you know) was a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, he was highly favoured for his wiſedome by two Emperours, <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> he was moderate in all his writings, he ſought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the palpable errors and hereſies of your Church, he indevoured to accord, and (if it had beene poſſible) to reconcile the differences on both ſides; and laſtly, he lived and died in the communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. <hi>Cecenas</hi> was a Frier, and Generall of the Order of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>de facto</hi> by the Pope; but it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <hi>quo jure,</hi> by what right, for if the accuſation were true, the Pope deſerved the puniſhment, and not the innocent Frier: liſten therefore to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and diſobedience for which he was accuſed. <hi>Cecenas</hi> ſhewes in particular that Pope <hi>John</hi> was a ſchiſmaticke and an heretike, in his peremptorie oppoſition againſt the Word of God and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church;<note place="margin">Mich. de Cece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na tractat. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra errores Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae p.

It was a part of their honour and vaine glory to ſpeake bigge words with great lookes among women, not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood when they diſputed of the Scriptures. The Preachers of the word were all ſworne to the word of their Maſters: and from hence ſprung ſixe hundred Sects; as namely,</hi> Thomiſts, Scotiſts, Occhamiſts,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:154277:95"/>Alexandrians, &amp;c. <hi>O heinous wickedneſſe! The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels and Epiſtles of the Apoſtles were laid aſide, true Divinitie lay hid, and was handled of very few; but coldly, I will not ſay, unfaithfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In what ſtate the Church remained in thoſe dayes, when <hi>Papall Traditions</hi> and cunning <hi>Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> prevailed againſt the ſacred Scriptures, let the Reader judge:<note place="margin">Onus Eccleſiae c. <hi>16.</hi> p. (mihi) <hi>79</hi>
                     </note> Your owne St. <hi>Francis</hi> foretold <hi>that the times were at hand, wherein many differences ſhould ariſe in the Church, when charitie ſhould waxe cold, iniquity ſhould abound, and the Divell ſhould be let looſe, and that the purity of his Roman Religion ſhould be depraved;</hi> and accordingly (ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) the Image of the Croſſe in the Church of St. <hi>Damian</hi> ſpake unto him;<note place="margin">Vade, repara domum meam, quae ut cernis, tota labitur.</note> 
                     <hi>Goe and repaire my houſe which you ſee is altogether decayed.</hi> Thus Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Friers, and Images, ſtocks and ſtones cried out of the falling away of your Church (if we may credit your owne Authors) and yet by no meanes you will aſſent to a reformation of doctrine or manners.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Luthers</hi> firſt riſing, which was almoſt 30. yeares before the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> your <hi>Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Guicciard. Hiſt. lib. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> that there were that yeare many mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings at <hi>Rome,</hi> to conſult what was beſt to be done. The more wiſe and moderate ſort wiſhed the Pope to reforme things apparently amiſſe, and not to perſecute <hi>Luther. Hieronymus Savanarola</hi> told the French King, <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. he ſhould have great proſperitie in his voyage into <hi>Italie, to the end hee ſhould reforme the ſtate of the Church, which if he did
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:154277:95"/>not reforme, he ſhould returne with diſhonour; and ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it fell out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come to the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelfe, where you may reade many decrees for reformation, and yet neither doctrine nor manners reformed. But let us heare your owne confeſſion. <hi>It is true, the Councell indeed complaineth with great reaſon of the avarice of ſuch whom the Knight calleth the Popes Collectors, though the Councell ſpeaketh not of the Pope: but falſe it is which he ſaith, that the Councell complaineth of Indulgences, an Article of faith (as his words are.) The Councell likewiſe complaineth of many things crept into the celebration of the Maſſe, and the words of the Councell are right cited by him in Latin in the Margent, but in the Engliſh he foully corrupteth them: For in ſtead of</hi> many things, <hi>hee tranſlated</hi> many errors, <hi>which is a groſſe errour and corruption in the Knight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe be your grand exceptions to the groſſe corruptions laid unto my charge; but all this while you doe not diſcharge the accuſations laid juſtly to your Church. And in this I muſt needs ſay, you play the Hypocrite, <hi>who can diſcerne a mote in your Brothers eye, and cannot ſee a beame in your owne:</hi> Firſt therfore caſt the beame out of your own eye, and then you ſhall eaſily diſccrne without Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that the <hi>Collectors</hi> of <hi>Indulgences</hi> are the <hi>Popes Collectors,</hi> although the Pope is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that place; and <hi>Indulgences</hi> are an Article of Faith created by that Councell, although the Councell proclaime it not an Article of Faith: ſo
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:154277:96"/>that <hi>(multa)</hi> many things, might well ſtand for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors and corruptions, ſince they were errors in practiſe. Neither would I have ſet the Latin in the Margent if I had meant to corrupt them in Engliſh; and withall, if you had taken the laſt edition (as you ought to have done) you ſhould have found them in another <hi>Character,</hi> and then all your waſte words of <hi>foule corruptions,</hi> had beene needleſſe. But in this you reſemble <hi>Palladius</hi> a lewd fellow, who in like manner charged St. <hi>Hierome</hi> with falſifications and falſe tranſlations: <hi>He preacheth and publiſheth abroad</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hierome</hi>) <hi>that I am a falſarie,</hi>

                     <hi>that I have not preciſely tranſlated word for word, that I, in ſtead of the word</hi> Honourable, <hi>have written theſe words,</hi> Deerely beloved: <hi>Theſe things and ſuch trifles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are laid unto my charge.</hi> Now heare what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer St. <hi>Hierome</hi> makes; <hi>Whereas the Epiſtle it ſelfe declareth, that there is no alteration made in the ſenſe, and that there is neither matter of ſubſtance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor any doctrine deviſed by me, verily by their great cunning they prove themſelves fooles, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to reprove other mens unskilfulneſſe, they betray their owne.</hi> Let us heare therefore the reſt of your <hi>Things</hi> (for ſo you will have me terme them) which are crept into your Church, and need a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>

                     <hi>The Councell</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſeemeth to acknowledge the avarice of Prieſts in ſaying Maſſe for mony, was not farre from Symonie.

                  </p>
                  <p>I perceive your paſſion makes you much forget your ſelfe: for your doctrine (I confeſſe) which is commonly received, is the ſame now, that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> but that it was ever the ſame, as now it is, all the Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Jeſuits cannot prove.

What is this elſe, but to joyne hands with the Proteſtants, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a reformation needfull in your Church, for requiring Service to bee celebrated in a knowne tongue, that the people may underſtand it? But that I may make good my aſſertion, and that the Reader may know I have ſaid nothing but the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:154277:97"/>truth, in affirming the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> did make decrees for Reformation for doctrine as well as manners, looke upon the ſecond <hi>Seſsion,</hi> and tell me if they did not profeſſe a reall intention in both.<note place="margin">Concil.

                     </note> the words of the Seſsion are theſe; <hi>Whereas it is the ſpeciall care and intention of the Councell, that (the darkeneſle of Hereſie being expelled, which ſo many yeares hath covered the earth) the light and parity of the Catholicke truth may ſhine, through the helpe of Chriſt which is the true light; and that thoſe things which need reformation may be reformed; the Synod exhorteth all Catholikes aſſembled, or to be aſſembled, and eſpecially thoſe who are skilful in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that with continuall meditation they may dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſider with themſelves how theſe things may bee effected; that they may condemne thoſe things which are to be condemned, and approve thoſe things which are to be approved, that the whole world with one mouth, and confeſsion of one and the ſame faith, may glorifie God the Faiher, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Take a review of the words of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; Firſt, <hi>Praecipua cura &amp; intentio, ut propulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis errorum tenebris, quae per tot annos operiarunt terram;</hi> the chiefe care to diſpell the darkeneſſe of errour which covered the earth: which words cannot be meant of the Proteſtant doctrine. For our light is pretended by you to be lately come in, and but in a part or corner of the world. Secondly, <hi>peritiam habeant ſacrarum literarum, ut ſedulâ me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatione ſecum ipſi cogitent, &amp;c. ut probare proban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, &amp; damnare damnanda queant.</hi> There needed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154277:98"/>not this diligence and skill in Scriptures for <hi>Luthers</hi> Religion, for they were condemned before by the Pope. Thirdly, <hi>Nullus debeat &amp;c. obſtinatis diſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationibus contendere,</hi> which ſhould not be about <hi>Lutheran</hi> points, but about doctrines of their owne.

                  <p>Now I pray, what thinke you of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels Decrees? Will not they extend to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in doctrine? or will you ſay that Hereſies in manners crept into the Church, and the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scriptures were chiefly to be imployed for reforming them, that thereby there might be one Faith of Papiſts and Proteſtants through the Chriſtian world?<note place="margin">De extirpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis haereſibus, &amp; moribus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formandis, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cauſa prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipue eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregata.

But herein the Reader ſhall eaſily diſcerne the policie of your Church. At the firſt calling of the Councell (when theſe firſt Seſſions were made) the number of Biſhops were but few, (about 40.) but after the faction of the Popes creatures in multitude prevailed, all hope of reformation was abandoned; And thereupon the Biſhops of <hi>Apulia</hi> publikely declared, that the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers <hi>were nothing elſe but the Popes crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and his bondſlaves;</hi>

It is the common Tenet of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at this day, that the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> was conceived without originall ſinne: yet the contrarie Tenet is likewiſe maintained by the members of your owne Church. <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> tells us, that <hi>two orders of Friers,</hi>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:154277:106"/>of, are negative Articles amongſt us, and the proofe lies on your ſide: If you cannot ſhew Apoſtolicall Authors for your owne doctrine, muſt we be therefore condemned, becauſe we doe not prove the Negative?

                  <p>You cannot denie that there are many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar errors in the Church, whoſe firſt Authors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be named by you nor us, and therefore will you conclude they are no errors? The cuſtome of communicating little children in the Sacrament of the Lords bodie and bloud was an error, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long in the ancient Church, yet the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it was not knowne. There were many did hold there was a mitigation and ſuſpenſion of the puniſhment of the damned in hell, by the ſuffrages of the living; this error was anciently received, yet the firſt Anthor was not knowne.

                  <p>IT is my promiſe in my ſeventh Section, to ſhew a deſcent of both Religions (as namely) that the Romiſh faith was derived from antient Haeretiks, and the Proteſtant faith was drawne downe from Chriſt and his Apoſtles.

                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſſe ingenuouſly, it is an errour in the print, and I ſhall willingly alter the letter, but not the words, at the next impreſſion. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently profeſſe, it is agreeable to the true ſenſe and meaning of the Author; and the ſtrength of the argument is not in the words, but in the ſenſe:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:154277:117"/>and therfore I may truly anſwer you with S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, What folly is it to contend about words,</hi>

                  <p>It cannot be denied, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> taxeth the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> who amongſt the <hi>Corinthians, in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatibus &amp; oblationibus,</hi> uſed ſometimes the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack, and ſometimes the Hebrew tongue, which without doubt, the <hi>Greeks</hi> underſtood not.

                     <hi>thoſe things muſt be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered which the hearers underſtand: for to what purpoſe, or profit is it, that any one ſpeake a tongue which hee himſelfe onely underſtands, and whereof hee that heareth can reape no fruit?</hi> And a little after; <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith, I had rather ſpeake five words in the Church, according to the Law, that I may edifie others, than any long and large diſcourſe in obſcuritie.</hi> Againe, by <hi>[Oblationibus]</hi> (which you interpret, <hi>Offrings</hi>) Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> cannot meane, the peoples gifts or offrings; (for there was no need of any ſpeech, much leſſe a long ſpeech at theſe offrings.)

                  <p>You proceed from one hereſie to another, <hi>(viz)</hi> from your unknown Service, to your Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.

                  <p>It is true, this particular Inſtance is cited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Tables of <hi>Theodoret;</hi> but yet you have affinitie with their Tenets, as neere as coſen Germans once removed. For as you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but one Chriſt in the heavens, and in the Hoſt, no more did thoſe Heretikes in words; for they rehearſed the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>Et in Ieſum Chriſtum,</hi> and not <hi>in Chriſtos:</hi> and as they made a two-fold Chriſt, one in heaven, another in earth; ſo likewiſe you teach, that Chriſt in the Sacrament (here on earth) is inviſible and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, but in heaven at the ſame time viſible, and with dimenſions of quantitie, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Organs. And what is this, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to make two Chriſts, or at leaſt, to make contradictories true at the ſame time, of one and the ſame Chriſt, in reſpect of his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be viſible and inviſible?</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>Marcus</hi> the Heretike, (you ſay) <hi>Hee changed the colour; but you teach, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and accidents remaine, and the ſubſtance is changed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true; and your opinion in this, is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than that of <hi>Marcus:</hi> for hee changed the Colour, to make the people beleeve it was true blood; and you make them beleeve it is blood, when there is neither taſt, nor colour of blood.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, touching the <hi>Capernaites;</hi> you deny there is any likeneſſe of Doctrine. <hi>For</hi> (ſay you) <hi>the Capernaites thought they ſhould eate Christs body piece-meale, but wee receive Chriſt whole and entire, not in the forme and ſhape of fleſh, but of bread, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But I pray, which of the Evangeliſts ever charged them with any ſuch conceit? The truth is, they underſtood the words of Chriſt as you doe, in a groſſe and carnall manner: and therfore Chriſt in reproving them, ſaith not, Fleſh eaten piece-meale, profiteth nothing; but abſolutely, <hi>The fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> As touching your eating of Chriſt, <hi>whole and intire;</hi> it is all one with their eating of him by piece-meale: for there may be many differences in eating, but all eating the fleſh of Chriſt with teeth and jawes, is <hi>Caperniticall.</hi> But you neither ſee, nor taſte the fleſh of Chriſt, which they dream'd they ſhould; for you receive it, <hi>Not</hi> (ſay you) <hi>in the forme of fleſh, but of bread.</hi> I will returne you an Anſwer from a learned Divine on our ſide:<note place="margin">B. <hi>Bilſon,</hi> in the difference between Chriſt ſubject, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. <hi>pag. 748.</hi>

                     <hi>You chaw the fleſh of Chriſt actually with your teeth, and ſwallow the ſame downe your throats, and theſe be proper actions, and right inſtruments of externall and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perniticall eating; your eyes and your taſte be not; elſe blind men, and ſuch as by reaſon of Sickneſſe can taſte nothing, by your Divinitie can eate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Since then you concurre with the Capernaites (in eating and ſwallowing) notwithſtanding you vary from them in ſight and taſte, yet your opinion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:154277:119"/>eſtabliſheth a corporall eating of Chriſts fleſh, and a perverting of the meaning of Chriſts words, no leſſe than theirs did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let mee paralell them together with the moſt favorable conſtruction I can, yet your Church muſt have her Antiquitie and deſcent from thoſe <hi>Capernaites.</hi> For, ſuppoſe the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Chriſt would kill himſelfe, and give his body to be eaten; yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that Chriſt did eate his owne fleſh, a thing no leſſe barbarous (being meant litterally) than to kill himſelfe.

Laſtly, let it be granted that the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did believe, that Chriſts fleſh ſhould be eaten when hee was dead; yet the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> is more brutiſh, to imagine his fleſh to be eaten when he was alive (being a higher degree of crueltie to devoure men alive,<note place="margin">Apertiſsimi lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From your Images, you proceed to your <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind,</hi> which I ſhewed was derived from the <hi>Manichees,</hi> &amp;c. You to excuſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:154277:126"/>ſay, <hi>That before there were Manichees in the world, the bleſſed Sacrament was adminiſtred ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one kind, ſometimes in both.</hi> You ſay ſo, but you ſay nothing to prove it; and your <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> will hardly carry it againſt a cloud of witneſſes. For confirmation of what I ſaid, that in this point of Doctrine you ſucceed the Heretikes, hearken to <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leo, Serm. <hi>4.</hi> de Quadrageſ.</note> 
                     <hi>The Manichees, to cover their infidelitie, venture to be preſent at our myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſo carry themſelves in receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments for their more ſafety, that they take the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt with an unworthy mouth: but in any wiſe, they ſhunne to drinke the blood of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I would have your devoutneſſe</hi> (ſpeaking to the people) <hi>learne; for by this ſacrilegious ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, they may be noted by the Godly, that they may be chaſed away by the Prieſtly power. Leo</hi> (you ſee) ſpeaketh of the <hi>Manichees</hi> by name, and thoſe Lay-men alſo; and calleth the forbearing the Lords blood, a Sacrilegious ſleight. Againſt theſe Heretikes alſo, wrote another Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſame age,<note place="margin">Grat. de Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat.

                  </p>
                  <p>What thinke you of your halfe Communion,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:154277:126"/>you that brag ſo much of the antiquitie of your Church? The <hi>Manichees,</hi> without doubt, were the firſt Authors of your Doctrine; and by the ſuffrages of two infallible Popes, your Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſacrilegious. <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>as at that time the Church forbad the uſe of one kind, ſo now it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth the uſe of both, and may againe give way when it ſhall ſeeme convenient for the uſe of both kinds.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemes you make no ſcruple to thwart the Inſtitution of Chriſt, nor the Cuſtom of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church: but becauſe in this point your Church is branded with Sacrilege, I thinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you could be content to joyne with the Proteſtants, and reſtore the Cup to the Lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but I would gladly know how it can be done? Is not your Communion in one kind, publiſhed and decreed by your Pope and Councell, for an Article of Faith? And is it in your Churches power to alter, and diſpenſe with Articles of Faith at her pleaſure?<note place="margin">Bulla Pij <hi>(4)</hi> Act. <hi>6.</hi> &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.

                     </note> Surely this Confeſſion proves, that your Church can create new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Beleefe, which elſewhere you deny; or elſe this is no Article of Faith, being contrary to the practiſe of the firſt and beſt ages; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, your infallible Pope and Councell, are guilty of Error and Sacrilege in a high degree.</p>
                  <p>For a concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this point, you ſay the words, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> (from whence we draw our ſucceſſion in Doctrine) were ſpoken to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and in them to Prieſts, not to the Laitie.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:154277:127"/>
                  <p>By this reaſon who ſeeth not, but you may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well take the Bread from the Lay people as the Cup, for that alſo was given onely to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? but if the Cup were proper for the Prieſts onely, why doe you deny it to your <hi>Non-conficient</hi> Prieſts? doe they ſtand in the place of Lay people? Nay more, were not all <hi>Non-conficients</hi> at the time of Chriſts Inſtitution? what ſtrange ſhifts and evaſions hath your Church, to uphold the Novelty of your faith? I will give you but one teſtimony of Antiquity: <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) <hi>where the Priests differ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chryſ. <hi>18.</hi> in <hi>2.</hi> Corinth.</note> 
                     <hi>as when we muſt receive the dreadfull myſteries; for it is not here, as it was in the old Law, where the Prieſt eates one part, and the people another, neither was it lawfull for the people to be partaker of thoſe things of which the Prieſt was; but now it is not ſo, but rather one Body is propoſed to all, and one Cup (to all.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To paſſe by innumerable authorities of the Ancients, which you know are full in our behalfe, I will ſhut up this haereticall point of doctrine (for ſuch is the foundation of it) with a teſtimony of your owne ſide.<note place="margin">Gerard. Lori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius de Miſſa publica proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda. p. mihi.</note> 
                     <hi>There are ſome falſe Catholikes that feare not to ſtop the Reformation of the Church, what they can; theſe ſpare no blaſphemy, leſt that other part of the Sacrament ſhould be reſtored to the Lay people: for</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Chriſt ſpake, drinke yee all of this, onely to the Apoſtles; but the words of the Maſſe be theſe, Take and eate yee all of this: Here I would know of them whether this were ſpoken
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:154277:127"/>onely to the Apoſtles: then muſt lay men abſtaine likewiſe from the Element of bread; which to ſay, is an haereſie, yea, a peſtilent and deteſtable blaſphemy. It is therefore conſequent that both theſe words. (Eate yee, Drinke yee) were ſpoken to the whole Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus your Ancient Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> termed your halfe Communion a Sacriledge, and this latter Author of your owne, termes it an haereſie, and a peſtilent Blaſphemy; and this may ſerve to prove your deſcent from the Haeretikes the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> in this point.</p>
                  <p>From your halfe Communion, you proceede to your <hi>Invocation of Angels,</hi> which I derived from the Haeretikes <hi>Angelici;</hi> and for anſwer to them, you ſay, <hi>they were Haeretikes ſwarving from the rule of the Catholike faith by exceſſe, that is, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels more then their due.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is your very caſe, for you doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour them, but religiouſly worſhip them, and call upon them.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now I appeale to your ſelfe, and to all your fellow-Jeſuites, whether your <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> to the bleſſed Virgin be not tranſcendent, or (to uſe your owne words) <hi>doth not exceed the meaſure of honour due unto our Lady?</hi> And conſequently, whether in this particular, upon your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, you are not deſcended from the <hi>Collyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Heretikes, your firſt parents?</p>
                  <p>This is ſo apparently true, that you know no way to free your ſelves from the guilt of Hereſie, but by waving the queſtion, telling us, <hi>The line ſhould be drawne along by a continued ſucceſsion, from the beginning to the end:</hi> whereas I told you at firſt, I did not undertake to prove that thoſe Heretikes, or your Church, had a perpetuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in perſon and doctrine; but to ſhew, <hi>How neere affinity you have with their adulterate iſſue.</hi> (For thoſe were my very words;) and thereupon I concluded, that you had no ſucceſſion in perſon and doctrine: but let us heare your anſwer? <hi>This is ſo falſe, and ſo apparently falſe, as that it is not to be doubted, but hee that ſhall averre it, will make no ſoruple of any lie, how lewd ſoever.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                  <p>Good words, and found proofes would better become men of your profeſſion. If you affirme
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:154277:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>that you have a Lineall Succeſſion, the proofe lyes on your ſide: and when I ſhall ſee it as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, as ſpoken, I ſhall readily confeſſe my error, till then, let me tell you, it is not your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Popes, which you ſay are ſold, and printed at <hi>London,</hi> that can make a firme agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſucceſſion in Faith. For by that reaſon, our Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memorie, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Queene <hi>Mary</hi> in Faith; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our Faith muſt be good by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.

                     <label>The Reply.</label> IN the eighth Section, I aſſumed to prove the Antiquitie, and Vniverſalitie of our Religion, by and with the conſenting teſtimonies of the Romane Church: you tell mee, <hi>It is a bold and unlikely adventure, and it is ſhameleſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words be like a houſe full of ſmoake without fire: but what is the occaſion of all this heinous complaint? Forſooth, <hi>the</hi> Knight <hi>brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not one Author, I ſay, not one for the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie and Antiquitie of his Church.</hi> And is this ſo grievous an accuſation? Surely, I thought there was none ſo ignorant or impudent, as to denie both the Vniverſalitie and Antiquitie of three Creeds; two Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt; the two and twentie books of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scriptures; of the firſt foure Generall <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels;</hi> of the Apoſtolike Traditions; of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liturgies; of the Ordination of Prieſts and Deacons. Theſe are our Tenets, and theſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:154277:134"/>were the particular Inſtances which I made: and to bring Authors for the proofe of theſe, as if we made a doubt of that which all true Chriſtians did generally receive and beleeve, I ſay with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inſolentiſsimae dementiae. <hi>Aug.</hi>

                     <hi>It were a ſigne of moſt inſolent madneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But admit I ſhould produce ſome Authors for proofe of this generall beleefe, would their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie free me from your termes of <hi>Shameleſſe, and impudent adventure?</hi> Certainly no: for (ſay you) <hi>If hee ſhould have one, two, or three, or ten men, it would not be ſufficient for him, unleſſe hee have the Authoritie of the Catholike Church, or Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>To cite many Authors, or to bring none, then is all alike to you; for in your doome, nothing will free mee from the <hi>name, and puniſhment due to Hereſie,</hi> but the authoritie of the Church: and yet in this, you have granted mee more than I could expect; for you have given mee liberty to take my authoritie from the Church, ſo it be from the <hi>Catholike,</hi> or the <hi>Roman.</hi> And hereby you have made your <hi>Roman</hi> Church diſtinct from the <hi>Catholike,</hi> which is moſt true; which, both you your ſelfe, and moſt of your fellow Jeſuits have made all one, and confirmed by the title of <hi>(Roman Catholike)</hi> in all your writings.</p>
                  <p>This being granted, I proceed to the reſt of your exceptions. <hi>In this Section</hi> (ſay you) <hi>he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth onely three Catholike Authors,</hi> Adrian, Coſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>and</hi> Harding, <hi>but no word for Antiquitie, or univerſalitie.</hi> Thus you.</p>

                  <p>Hee that ſhall reade my Section in <hi>Via tuta,</hi> with this your Anſwer, muſt needs confeſſe that you deale not fairly, nor ingeniouſly with mee: for ſometimes you leape from the beginning of a Chapter to the end, then you returne againe to the beginning, being willing to conceale or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the truth of my Aſſertions. You ſo mingle my words with your own in the ſame Character, that a prudent Reader can hardly diſcerne mine from yours: but moſt uſuall it is with you to cry down my words with bitter paſſages, and decline the queſtion in all. As for Inſtance, in this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereas I ſaid, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth confeſſe the Antiquitie, and Vniverſalitie of our Religion long before <hi>Luther,</hi> I inſtanced in our three <hi>Creeds,</hi> and the reſt before named. One while you cry out of my impudencie, that I cite no Authors; another while, that if I did cite them, they would not ſerve my turne: but you never mention either the <hi>Creeds,</hi> or <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or <hi>Councels,</hi> or any of the points which you well knew had Antiquitie, and Vniverſalitie in the name and opinion of all Chriſtians. After that, you flie to the later end of my Section, and there you tell mee, I cite but three Authors, and yet none prove the Antiquitie or Vniverſalitie of our Faith. Then you goe backe againe, and you tell the Reader, <hi>I ſay nothing here of the mans notable cunning and falſhood, in making him beleeve, as if we did excuſe our ſelves in thoſe things whereof they accuſe us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:154277:135"/>
                  <p>If ſuch extravagant excurſions and reproches you call a Reply, or a Catholike Anſwer, I will lay my finger on my mouth, and ſay with your <hi>Cardinall, Qui decipi vult, decipiatur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Briefely, the ſubſtance of my Aſſertion was this: The three <hi>Creeds,</hi> the Canonicall <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the Apoſtolike <hi>Traditions,</hi> the foure firſt generall <hi>Councels,</hi> and the reſt were ſo generally received in the boſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that for that reaſon it might ſeeme a ſenſeleſſe queſtion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand where our Church was before <hi>Luther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next I ſhewed that the poſitive Doctrines of our Church (mentioned in our (39.) Articles) were contained in a very few points, and thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had Antiquity and Vniverſality; then I ſhewed that thoſe doctrines which they obtruded upon us, were but Additions and Negative Tenets in our Articles, and that many of thoſe additions were condemned, or at leaſt excuſed, by their owne men: And I inſtanced in three Authors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, for three ſeverall points of their Doctrine; and this is the ſubſtance and true meaning of that Section; and thus much by way of advertiſement to the moderate Reader. Now to anſwer you diſtinctly to that you have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced confuſedly.</p>
                  <p>Your firſt exception is touching Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth: you ſay, <hi>It is not as</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Humphry <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, to wit if the conſecrated Bread be Christ, but if it be rightly conſecrated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And doe not you ſtill by <hi>Adrians</hi> confeſſion
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:154277:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>excuſe your adoration, by implying a condition? and is it not all one according to your doctrine? For if it be rightly conſecrated, it is Chriſt, if not, it is a Cruſt, and no man amongſt your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants knoweth what it is, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Prieſts intention. Take it therefore which way you will, yet my aſſertion ſtands true; we condemne you for adoring the Elements, for ought you know, of bread and wine, becauſe it doth depend upon the intention of the Prieſt, whether Chriſt be there or no; but yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemne us for adoring Chriſts, rent body in the Heavens: and however the Prieſts doe conſecrate, yet (ſaith <hi>Gerſon</hi>) <hi>when the hoſt is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that condition is ever at leſt to be ſuppoſed (if it be rightly conſecrated)</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Gerſ. compend. Theol. Tit. de tribus virtut. p. <hi>111.</hi>
                     </note> if it be truely the body of Chriſt; And this is that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> hath delivered by your owne confeſſion, and therefore they are not to be cleered from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, becauſe they intended to worſhip one God, (as indeede there was but one God) but becauſe they adored him there where he was not, and in that manner as they ſuppoſed him to be. <hi>The caſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Catharinus</hi>) <hi>is like in the hoſt not conſecrated:</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>For God and Chriſt is not adored ſimply, but as he is exiſting under the formes of bread and wine. If therefore he be not there, but it be found that Divine worſhip is given to a creature insteede of Chriſt, there is Idolatry alſo: For even in this regard they were Idolaters who adored Heaven, or any other thing, ſuppoſing with themſelves that they adored
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:154277:136"/>in it the Divinity, whom they called the ſoule of the world.</hi> Compare then the certainty of your faith, with ours (which is the point in queſtion) and tell me if in this we are not more certaine and ſafe then you can be. Firſt, your owne <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">Bell. de Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>none can be certaine by the certainity of faith that he doth receive a true Sacrament. No man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Andreas Vega</hi>) <hi>can beleeve aſſuredly, that he receiveth the leaſt part of the Sacrament,</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>and this is ſo ſurely to be credited, as it is apparant that we live;</hi> And both give one and the ſame reaſon for it: For there is no way, except it be by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we can know the intention of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, either by outward appearance, or by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of faith. From this dangerous conſequence, we condemne your adoration, and reſolve to let you know from your owne men,<note place="margin">Th. Saliſtar. de arte Praedican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di. c. <hi>25.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>No man, be he never ſo ſimple, or never ſo wiſe, ought preciſely to believe that this is the body of our Lord that the Prieſt hath conſecrated, but onely under this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if all things concerning the conſecration be done as appertaineth; for otherwiſe he ſhall avouch a creature to be the Creator, which were Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as this way in the generall is uncertaine and dangerous; ſo likewiſe there are many other wayes, which may eaſily occaſion this Idolatry; and therefore you cannot deny us to be in the more certaine and ſafe way. As for inſtance <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes de Burgo,</hi> who was Chancellor of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> about (200.) yeares ſince, gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that a Prieſt may faile in his intention
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:154277:136"/>many wayes. As for example,<note place="margin">Pupilla Oculi c. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>5.</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Bread be made of any other then wheaten flower, which may poſsibly happen, or if there be too much water in quantity, that it overcomes and alters the nature of wine; if the wine be changed into vinegar, and therefore cannot ſerve for conſecration; If there be thirteene cakes upon the Table, and the Prieſt for his conſecration determine onely upon twelve, in that caſe not one of them all is Conſecrated: Laſtly, if the Prieſt diſſemble, or leave out the words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, or if he forget it, or minde it not, in all and every of theſe wayes, there is nothing Conſecrated, and conſequently the people giving divine honour to the Sacrament all Bread or Cup, commit flat Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I heare the Apoſtle proclaime to all Chriſtians, that <hi>he which doubteth is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;</hi> I cannot chuſe but pitty the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of that miſerable man, who hath a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, perplexed, and uncertaine faith, who taketh all upon truſt, and upon the report, ſometimes of an Hypocrite, ſometimes of a malitious Prieſt, who hath no intention at all to adminiſter the true Sacrament.<note place="margin">Hiſtory of Trent.</note> 
                     <hi>For</hi> (ſaith your <hi>Trent</hi> hiſtory) <hi>if a Prieſt having charge of foure or five hundred ſoules were an Infidell, but a formall Hyppocrite, and in abſolving the Penitent, baptizing of children, and Conſecrating the Euchariſt, had an intention not to doe that which the Church doth, it muſt be ſaid that the children are damned, the penitent not abſolved, and that all remaine without the fruite of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>

                  <p>Now let the Reader judge which doctrine is moſt certaine and ſafe, either that of your Church which may occaſion flat Idolatry in the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or our <hi>ſurſum corda,</hi> with hearts and eyes lifted up to Heaven, where we adore our Saviour Chriſt in his bodily preſence according to the Article of your Faith and ours; and this is agreed on both ſides to be without feare or perill of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as if you were guilty of falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you ſay, <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> Adrian <hi>hath erred in this, or in any other point, doth it follow that he agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with you in all other?</hi> Then you tell a ſtory of the Popes <hi>Bull</hi> againſt <hi>Luther.</hi>

                  <p>Touching your worſhipping of Images, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to his proper Section. And whereas wee charge you with flat Idolatrie in the adoration of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> of <hi>Reliques,</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> and the like; howſoever, I ſay, you excuſe your ſelves with the manner of your adoration, yet (to our endleſſe comfort be it ſpoken) you cannot charge us in the Poſitive Doctrine of our Church; no, not with the leaſt ſuſpition of Idolatrie. This I told you before, and (bleſſed be God) you have not wherewith to charge us in your Reply. But
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:154277:140"/>you ſay, <hi>It is far greater evill for you to be truly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Hereſie, than for us to be charged with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie:</hi> yet neither you, nor all your fellow-Jeſuits could ever prove us guilty of either. But what may wee thinke of your Church, which is juſtly charged, and highly guilty of both? Your Popes (which the Jeſuits reſolve to be the Church) are condemned for Heretikes by your Councels, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Heretikes by the Popes themſelves, and condemned of Hereſie by your beſt learned Divines. Your worſhip of Images and Saints, concludes in flat Idolatrie; and in particular (by the Doctrine of your owne Church) the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacramentall Bread and Cup, (for want of a right intention) becomes an Idoll in the Temple. Theſe things I have in part proved, which in place convenient, ſhall be more fully handled hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But it is obſervable, after I had ended my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with this point of Idolatrie, I ſay, after this concluſion, you flye backe to the middle of the chapter, and now queſtion me where our <hi>Church</hi> was before <hi>Luther:</hi> but when I anſwered that from your addition, and Articles of Faith, <hi>The queſtion doth truly reſult upon your ſelves; Where was your Church? that is, where was your</hi> Trent <hi>Doctrine, and Articles of the</hi> Roman <hi>Creed, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> de fide <hi>before</hi> Luther? You are ſo farre from ſhewing it, that you cunningly ſuppreſſed theſe words, and not ſo much as mentioned them: and thus, one while ſuppreſſing the point in queſtion;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:154277:140"/>other whiles, by declining the true ſtate of the queſtion, you ſhew your wit is better than your cauſe, and declare your Sophiſtrie to be better than your Divinitie.</p>

                  <p>It were no difficult matter, to ſhew you many that did ſeperate both from you, and the errours of your Church in former Ages.

                     <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of longer continuance; for ſome ſay it hath continued from the time of</hi> Sylveſter, <hi>(which is three hundred yeares after Chriſt) others ſay, from the time of the Apoſtles. Secondly, becauſe it is more Vniverſall, for there is ſcarſe any Country, wherein this Sect hath not crept. Thirdly, whereas all other ſorts blaſpheme God, this Sect hath a great ſhew of godlineſſe: for they live juſtly before men, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve all rightly concerning God, and the Articles of the Creed; onely they ſpeake evill of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and hate it; and by this meanes draw mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:154277:141"/>to their beliefe after them.</hi> Thus if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Antiquity for their Doctrine, they derive it either from Chriſt, or from <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> 300. yeares after Chriſt; if Vniverſality, all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were filled with their Doctrine; if good life, they lived well before men, and beleeved all rightly concerning God, and the Articles of their Faith; and this the force of truth hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from your grand Inquiſitor.</p>

                     <hi>and we rejoyce with many others, but eſpecially in this, that in many things your doctrine is agreeable to our Church.</hi> For a concluſion, <hi>the Muſcovites, Armenians, Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Aethiopians,</hi> and divers other countries and Nations (all members of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church) taught our doctrine from the Apoſtles time to ours. This is ſo true an evidence in our behalfe, that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bellarm. de ver.

                  <p>Thus I have briefely ſhewed you two ſorts of Chriſtians, who were diſtinct from you, and yet lived in the Communion of the Catholike Church. I ſhewed you others alſo which lived and died in the boſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but as farre different in opinion from your now profeſſed Faith, as thoſe that went out from you. The firſt ſort ſeparated themſelves from your Church and Doctrine, the latter continued in communion with you, but ſeparated themſelves from the errors of prevayling faction in your Church: the one ſort you perſecuted unto death, for the other you cut out their tongues for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth.</p>

Surely if you compare the true and fruitfull Olive to your ſelves, and us unto the baſtard, and wild Olive, the matter (as you ſay) will be eaſily anſwered: but this is to beg the point in queſtion, neither indeede can it be granted to you, without a ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>But here is one thing</hi> (ſay you) <hi>which giveth mee much cauſe of wonder; which is, that you talke of Traditions, as diſtinct from Scripture. I ever tooke you to be ſo fallen out with them, that you made the deniall of them a fundament all point of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that you would not indure the word Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but alwaies tranſlated, or rather falſified it into Ordinances.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                  <p>It is a true ſaying of the Heathen Orator;<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee who once goeth beyond the bounds of Modeſtie, had need to be luſtily impudent.</hi> I proteſt, I onely ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med your Additions, <hi>Traditions;</hi> and you que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion our Church, for falſe tranſlating of the word. And cannot wee indure the word <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> Doe not we allow of all the Apoſtolicall <hi>Traditions,</hi> which agree unto the Scriptures? Nay more, doe wee not tranſlate the word <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> in the Scripture, when the Text will beare it according to the Greeke originall? Looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fifteenth of <hi>Matthew,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For a concluſion of this Section; you ſay, that the three Creeds, the two Sacraments, the foure Generall Councels, the two and twenty books of Canonicall Scripture, <hi>We had them from you.</hi> Let it be your comfort then, that you had ſomething in your Church which was worth the gleaning, after the devill had ſowed the Tares amongſt the good Corne. But I would not have you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much confident of that neither; for originally wee had them from the Church Catholike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a <hi>Roman.</hi> For, the Goſpell was preached in <hi>England</hi> before it was in <hi>Rome;</hi> and we had in <hi>England,</hi> a Chriſtian Church and King, before <hi>Rome</hi> had a Chriſtian <hi>Emperor,</hi> yea long before Poperie, or the name of <hi>Pope</hi> was heard of in the Chriſtian world; (in the ſenſe you now take it.) And in after Ages, when the Goſpell of Chriſt was rooted out by Heathen perſecutors (where it was firſt planted) it was afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by Preachers, partly ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> partly by the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, but by neither was the Faith preached and reſtored; which your preſent Church now teacheth, and maintaineth at this day.</p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:154277:146"/>
                  <p>And laſtly, if wee had the three Creeds, the two Sacraments, the 22. bookes of Canonicall Scripture, and the firſt foure Generall Councels from you, then you cannot deny that we teach the Ancient Faith, firſt given to the Saints; and that we had a Church viſible long before <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes, (for thoſe <hi>Tenents</hi> were ſufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make a glorious, and a viſible Church in the firſt and beſt ages) they were received by ſucceeding Chriſtians in all the later Ages, and are now become the Poſitive, and Affirmative Articles of our Beleefe, which for the greater part, were ever taught and received in the boſom of your owne Church. To ſhut up all your bitter Aſperſions, of Corrupting, of Falſifying, of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of Lynding, and I know not what reproches, caſt upon me in theſe firſt (8) Sections; I will ſhut up all, I ſay, which hitherto hath beene delivered by you, with that anſwer of <hi>Socrates</hi> to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, before the Judges:<note place="margin">Plato in Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Socratis.</note> 
                     <hi>My Lords</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>in what ſort your affections have been ſtirred with mine accuſers eloquence which you heard them ſpeake, I cannot tell. But well I wot, for mine owne part, I my ſelfe, whom it toucheth moſt, was almoſt perſwaded to beleeve, that what they ſaid was true, yea although it were againſt my ſelfe; ſo handſomly they can tell their tale, and ſo likely, and ſo ſmoothly they convey their maters: every word they ſpake, had appearance of Truth, and yet in good ſooth, they have ſcarſely uttered one word of Truth.</hi>

I anſwer, that the publike and ſolemne time at which all were bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the Eaſterne Church, was but once a yeare, to wit at Eaſter: yet did the people in thoſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:154277:175"/>dayes both at other times, and eſpecially when they lay on their death-bed, receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: which was therefore called <hi>Viaticum morientium.</hi> As for S. <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> 'tis true that he <hi>much complaineth of the backwardneſſe of the people in comming to the Communion, and profeſſeth for his owne part, that hee neglected not his dutie to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the holy Sacrament, though hee were much diſcouraged therein by the paucitie and raritie of thoſe, who preſented themſelves at the Lords Table:</hi> yet I find not that he any where ſaith, that he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Communion when there was none to participate with him. For though it may bee at ſome time eſpecially on the weeke dayes, none of the people did communicate with him: yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſome of the Clergie, who aſſiſted that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on communicated with him; and therefore the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> inference, <hi>that by our doctrine the Prieſt muſt not ſay Maſſe once in ſeven yeares, unleſſe the people bee ſo devout as to receive with him,</hi> is moſt abſurd. For in all Colledges, and Cathedrall Churches, the Prieſts and Deacons communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate every moneth at the leaſt, though none of the people ſometimes receive with them.

It is an heavier thing then he is a ware of to have the curſe of a mother, and ſuch a mother as the Church which doth not curſe without cauſe,<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſticus 3.11.</note> nor out of paſsion.

                  <p>The <hi>Knights</hi> definition of a Sacrament,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to wit, that it is a ſeale witneſsing to our conſciences, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154277:179"/>Gods promiſes are true is ſenſeleſſe, and without ground, largely refuted by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

For confirmation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Vnction have the element, and the Word, to wit, oyle and the forme: order and penance have inſtitution from Chriſt, as is confeſſed in order the patten with an Hoſt and Chalice with wine in it is the outward element: in penance humble confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with prayer, faſting, and almes-deedes, are the outward element: in Matrimonie the bodyes of a man or woman are as much an outward element, as water in baptiſme: and though Matrimonie might bee a naturall contract before the Goſpell, yet was it exalted to the dignitie of a Sacrament by Chriſt, and though it bee an holy thing as order is, yet as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is forbidden to all women, ſo upon good reaſon Mariage is forbidden to all Prieſts: becauſe it is good,

                     <p>To the firſt.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The <hi>Ieſuit</hi> in this Paragraph thinketh that hee diſcourſeth very profoundly, for page 201. he ſaith, <hi>the</hi> Knight <hi>is not capable of it;</hi> whereas his <hi>chanel</hi> here is ſo <hi>ſhallow,</hi> that any child inſtructed in his Catechiſme, may <hi>wade</hi>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:154277:183"/>thorow it. <hi>Without an infallible rule,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there can be no certaine beliefe in God.</hi> An extreame ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <hi>without an unerring Pope no certaine rule of faith,</hi> an extreame falſitie: the <hi>Ieſait</hi> cannot ſee Chriſt for the Pope, nor the Scripture for the <hi>Trent</hi> Canons. Let him remove them out of the way; and if hee have an eye of faith, hee may clearly ſee both, and in them an infallible rule of faith, and certaine meanes to learne true beliefe in God. The occaſion of this diſcourſe of the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> was the <hi>Knight</hi> charging Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> for laying a foundation of Atheiſme in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if we ſhould take away the credit of the Roman Church and Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Chriſtian faith it ſelfe might bee called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The charge lieth heavie upon the Cardinall. For to diſparage the ſelfe-ſufficiencie of the holy Scriptures, and ſuſpend our Chriſtian faith upon the Decrees of a late factious conventicle, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the greater part of the Chriſtian world, is a ready way to overthrow all Divine faith, and true religion. Yet the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> ſeeketh to cover the nakedneſſe of the Cardinall with theſe <hi>fig leaves, If agener all Councell may erre, the Church may erne; if the Church may erre, the faith which that Church teacheth may faile, and conſequently there can bee no certaintie.</hi> How eaſily are theſe leaves plucked away, and torne in pieces. 1. Though ſuch a Councell as the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a few Biſhops ſwaied by the Italian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may erre, it would not from thence follow,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:154277:183"/>that the whole repreſentative Church might erre. 2. Though the whole repreſentative Church in a free and generall Councell lawfully called might erre, yet many millions in the Catholique Church may hold the orthodox beliefe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the faith of the Church not totally faile. Yea but ſaith the <hi>Ieſuit, take away the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie of the Church there is no rule of faith.</hi> This aſſertion of his is open blaſphemie, as if God would not bee true, though all men were found liars: though the Roman Church and Pope erre a thouſand times, yet the rule of faith remaineth unvariable in the holy Scriptures. Yea but S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> equalizeth the foure firſt generall Councels to the Goſpel, and ſaith in effect, that they could as little erre as the 4. Goſpels, and that upon the deniall of their authoritie the Chriſtian faith might be ſhaken as well as by the deniall of the Goſpels: and the like authoritie giveth your Parliament unto them. I anſwer, S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualizeth the foure firſt generall Councels to the foure Goſpels, not in reſpect of authoritie, but in reſpect of the veritie of the articles defined in them: he ſaith not, <hi>they could as little erre,</hi> but <hi>they did as little erre,</hi> in their deciſions, or to ſpeake more properly that their doctrine was as true as Goſpell, becauſe the determinations in thoſe firſt generall Councels againſt Heretiques are evidently deduced out of holy Scriptures. Our Parliament alluding to the words of S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſpeaketh in the ſame ſenſe, as hee doth. Yea but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154277:184"/>ſaith the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> your Parliament lawes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that for hereſie whatſoever is condemned for ſuch in any of thoſe Councels, which is in other words to acknowledge them for a rule of faith, and conſequently to bee of infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and to joyne them in the ſame ranke with the Canonicall Seriptures. <hi>Idem jungat Vulpes;</hi> by the like reaſon the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> might ſay we joyne the booke of Articles of Religion, and Homilies in the ſame ranke with the Canonicall Scriptures, becauſe we condemne for heretiques all that obſtinatly maintaine any doctrine repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them: which wee doe not, becauſe we hold the Decrees of a provinciall Synod, to bee of in fallible authoritie: but becauſe wee are able to prove all the Articles there eſtabliſhed, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the holy Scriptures. Yea, but further ſaith the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> in the ſame ſtatute,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>you give power to the Court of Parliament, with the aſſent of the Clergie in their Convocation to adjudge or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a matter to be hereſie, which is the very ſame as to give it power to declare faith, or to be the rule thereof.</hi> I anſwer, the ſtatute giveth power to the Convocation, to declare faith, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine hereſie out of Gods word, and by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thereof, and no otherwiſe. In ſuch ſort to declare faith, is not to be the rule of faith, but to judge and meaſure things by the rule. There is a maine difference betweene theſe two, (which yet the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> here confoundeth as if they were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident) to declare faith, and to bee the rule of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154277:184"/>faith every Iudge declareth the Law, yet is he not the rule of the Law. The Inquiſitors in their <hi>jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices expurgatorij,</hi> and the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> in their cenſures declare what is hereſie: yet the y are not Itrow the Rule of popiſh faith, every meater in the market declareth that ſuch or ſuch is the meaſure of corne and graine: yet is not every, or any corne-meater the Wincheſter ſtanderd. It is one thing to be the rule, and another to meaſure by the rule, and declare what we have meaſured. But to retort the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> phraſe upon himſelfe, hee is not <hi>capable</hi> it ſeemes of this diſcourſe which yet every market-woman or boy is. Well, let the authoritie of generall Councels bee great in the Church, and of the foure firſt Councels greateſt of all, <hi>quid hoc ad Rombum?</hi> what maketh this for the infallibilitie of the <hi>Trent</hi> conventicle? much ſaith the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> every way, for <hi>what,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>can you ſay more againſt the preſent Church, and preſent Councell of Trent, then againſt the Church and Councels of thoſe times?</hi> What can we ſay? nay what can we not ſay? what have we not ſaid? or what could all the Papiſts in the world anſwer to what wee have already ſaid? After hee hath taken away the legall exceptions made againſt this conventicle by the Authour of the hiſtorie of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and of the <hi>litterae miſsivae,</hi> and <hi>Iewel</hi> his Treatiſe affixed to that Hiſtorie, and <hi>Chemniſius</hi> his Examen, and Doctor <hi>Bowles</hi> his latine Sermon preached to the Convocation, and lately printed: after hee hath

                        <hi>for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the Councell of God,</hi> hee ſaith that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the doctrine by him preached, not of the written word of God: as in like manner our Saviour ſaith, <hi>that what hee heard from his Father hee made knowne unto them, Iohn</hi> 15.15. and yet delivered not one word in writing. It is true, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he preached, but it is as true that the doctrine which he preached hee confirmed unto them by teſtimonie of Scripture.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154277:185"/>and alledging that Ieſus whom hee preached unto them was Chriſt, and they that received the word with all readineſſe of mind ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo:</hi>

For who knoweth not that repentance towards God, and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Ieſus Chriſt are written almoſt in every Sermon of the Prophets, and chapter of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts. What hee addeth for confirmation of his anſwer, (from the example of our Saviour, who made knowne to his Diſciples whatſoever hee heard from his Father, and yet delivered not one word in writing) no whit at all helpeth his cauſe. For albeit we grant that our Saviour wrote nothing (except wee give credit to a relation in <hi>Euſebius</hi> of a letter written by him to King <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garus</hi>) yet hee commanded his Apoſtles to write thoſe <hi>things which they had heard and ſeene, what thou ſeeſt write it in a booke,</hi>

For what correſpondencie is betweene theſe, and abſolution or remiſſion of ſinnes? how doth Faſting or Almes exhibit to the eye this inviſible grace? Contrition of the heart of which hee ſpeaketh, is no viſible or ſenſible ſigne, Confeſſion is ſenſible, but not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, nor ordained as the elements are in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſignifie the grace of God, but to aske it: the ſacred ſignes ought to be adminiſtred by the Prieſt, but Confeſſion is made by the penitent, the ſame may be ſaid of corporall ſatisfactions which are accompliſhed by the ſinner, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in his houſe by faſtings, or whippings, or abroad by pilgrimages, whereas ſacred ſignes are to bee adminiſtred by the hands of the Prieſt, and ordinarily in the Church; Abſolution alſo cannot bee a ſacred ſigne of the grace of God, ſeeing that if it bee good and available, it is the grace of God; beſides this Abſolution, is not an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:154277:195"/>element, nor a viſible ſigne of an inviſible grace, for the words are not ſeene: if it be ſaid that it is ſufficient, that it is ſignificantly the grace of God, by the ſame reaſon the preaching of the Word ſhould bee a ſacrament, for it is ſignificantly the grace of God. In all Sacraments the Word muſt bee joyned to the element; but here they will have the Word to bee an element: the impoſition of the Prieſts hands on the penitent is a viſible action, but not a viſible element, nor is it inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt. When the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell, and the Roman Catechiſme come to aſſigne the matter of this Sacrament, they doe it very faintly with a <hi>quaſi materia, Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>de poenit. c.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Catechiſ.

                     <p>For <hi>Matrimonie,</hi> it is a holy ordinance of God, but more ancient then the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore can be no ſeale of it: it was inſtituted by God in Paradiſe, not by Chriſt in the Goſpell: yea but (ſaith the <hi>Ieſuit</hi>) though it were before a naturall contract, yet might it not be exalted by Chriſt to the dignitie of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I anſwer, the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> muſt not diſpute what Chriſt might doe, but what hee did; When hee proveth out of the Evangeliſts or Apoſtles, that Chriſt exalted it to the dignitie of a Sacrament, wee will hold it in that high eſteeme, but this hee can never doe: for none of the Evangeliſts relate that hee altered the Law, or nature of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:154277:195"/>but only that hee confirmed it, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with his preſence, and the firſt Miracle which hee wrought.

                     <p>Our ſecond exception againſt the Sacrament of Matrimonie is, that in it there is no outward element ſanctified by the Word of promiſe.

Whereunto I reply, that though the word <hi>Sacramenta</hi> for the number may bee as well ſaid of ſeven as two Sacraments: yet where S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> alludeth to the ſame text of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154277:198"/>Scripture, and falleth upon the ſame conceite, he reſtraineth the number to two, ſaying, <hi>there iſſued out of Chriſts ſide water and blood, quae ſunt Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae gemina Sacramenta.</hi> Now I would faine know of the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> where ever hee read <hi>gemina</hi> to ſignifie ſeven, or more then two? Were the <hi>Dioſcuri</hi> which are commonly knowne by the name of <hi>gemini</hi> ſeven, or two only, to wit, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollax?</hi> As for S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> though they ſay not <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> that the two Sacraments of the Church iſſued out of Chriſts ſide, as <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> doth: yet they can bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of no more then two Sacraments: for there were but two things which iſſued out of our Saviours ſide, to wit, water and blood, whereby they underſtand Baptiſme and the Lords Supper. Had there iſſued out of our Saviours ſide, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with water and blood Chriſme or <hi>balſamum,</hi> or had a rib beene taken from thence, the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> might have ſome colour to draw more Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of it: but now ſith the Text ſaith there iſſued onely <hi>two things, water and blood;</hi> and the Fathers ſay the Sacraments of the Church are thereby meant: it is moſt apparant that by <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta</hi> they meant thoſe two only: which they there name in expreſſe words, Baptiſme and the price of our redemption, that is Chriſts blood in the Euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>To the ſeventh. The authoritie of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is as a thorne in the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> eye, for it cannot but bee a great prejudice to their cauſe, that ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154277:198"/>a Biſhop as S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> writing ſix bookes profeſſedly of the Sacraments omitteth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh five, and ſpendeth his whole diſcourſe upon our two. If the Church in his time beleeved or adminiſtred ſeven Sacraments, hee could no way be excuſed of ſupine negligence for making no mention at all of the greater part of them: it were all one as if a man profeſſing to treate of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the parts of the world which are foure, or of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> or the <hi>Septentriones,</hi> or the Planets which are ſeven ſhould handle but two of that number. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore and after him <hi>Flood</hi> pluck hard at this thorne, but cannot get it out (ſaying that <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> his intent was to inſtruct the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> only, as the title of one of the books ſheweth.) For firſt <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> hath no booke of that title, <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>inſtruction to them who are to bee catechized, or are beginners in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie.</hi> The title of that booke is <hi>De ijs qui ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiantur, of thoſe who are initiated or entred into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly myſteries.</hi> Secondly, this is not the title of any of the ſix bookes <hi>de ſacramentis</hi> alledged by the <hi>Knight,</hi> but of another tractate. Thirdly, admit that <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> as <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> wrote to the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and intended a Catechiſme: yet they were to name all the Sacraments unto them, as all Divines uſually doe in their Catechiſmes: becauſe the Sacraments are alwayes handled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the grounds, and principles of Chriſtian religion. And though the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> are not preſently admitted unto all, yet they are to learne
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:154277:199"/>what they are, that they may bee the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in due time to receive them. Fourthly, it is evidently untrue (which the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> ſaith) that <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> writeth not to the beleevers of that age, but only to ſome beginners. The very <hi>front</hi> of his booke proves the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> to bee <hi>frontleſſe.</hi> For <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> his firſt words are, <hi>I will begin to ſpeake of the Sacraments which wee have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp;c. In Chriſtiano enim viro prima eſt fides, for the firſt thing in a Chriſtian man is faith.</hi> And as hee writeth to all beleevers not beginners on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo hee ſpeaketh alſo of the chiefe Sacraments of the New Teſtament, and not of thoſe only which the <hi>catechumeni</hi> received, as is apparant out of the fourth chapter of the firſt booke <hi>De ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis.</hi> Wherein hee proveth according to the title of that Chapter, <hi>Quôd ſacramenta Chriſtia. norum diviniora ſint, &amp; priora quàm Indaeorum, That the Sacraments of the Chrìſtians are more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and more divine then thoſe of the Iewes;</hi> and hee inſtanceth eſpecially in the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> Laſtly, the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> in this anſwer apparantly contradicteth himſelfe, firſt, ſaying that <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> intent in that Worke was only to inſtruct the <hi>catechumeni</hi> in thoſe things that were to be done <hi>in the time of Baptiſme,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">p. 210.</note> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few lines after he ſaith,<note place="margin">Bud. deaſse, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas nonnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam invitis erumpit as fallens inter mendacia ab audientibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muns agnoſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cum inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim loquentes adbuc ſe habere in poteſtate putent.</note> that he <hi>writeth of the Sacraments whereby they were ſo initiated which are three, Baptiſme, Confirmation, and the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</hi> So true is <hi>Budaeus</hi> his obſervation, That lyes daſh one with the other, and truth breakes out of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:154277:199"/>the mouth of the lyar ere hee is aware. Who ever heard of the Euchariſt to bee adminiſtred in the time of Baptiſme, or that the Euchariſt was adminiſtred at all to the punies or <hi>catechumeni</hi> whileſt they were ſuch, certainly if the <hi>catecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni</hi> or younger beginners, to whom hee ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wrote, were capable of the doctrine of the Euchariſt, containing in it the higheſt myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſtianitie, they were much more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Penance, Matrimonie, and Extreame Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which are eaſie to bee underſtood by any novice in Chriſtian religion.</p>
                     <p>To the eight.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> That it may appeare what was the judgement of S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> in this maine point of difference, betweene the Reformed and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, I will weigh what is brought on both ſides, firſt what the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> alledgeth for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and then what the <hi>Knight</hi> for two. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> having written divers Catechiſticall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, in which hee had occaſion to name and handle the Sacraments: yet no where defineth the number of them to bee ſeven, neither nameth all of them either joyntly or ſeverally: this the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> knowing well enough, bringeth no one teſtimonie for the proofe of their ſeven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of him, but forceth only ſome ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to prove out of them that hee held more then two, as namely out of his firſt Sermon upon the 103. Pſalme, <hi>Caſt thine eyes upon the gifts or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Church in Baptiſme, the Euchariſt, and the reſt of the holy Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 118.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154277:200"/>having brought in two Sacraments, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, hee addeth ſuch a generall clauſe, <hi>and if there bee any thing elſe commended in holy Scriptures;</hi> which words of his import that hee held more ſacraments then Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, in that very ſenſe wherein thoſe two by him named are called Sacraments. I anſwer, <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> in neither of theſe places ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the word Sacrament in a ſtrict ſenſe: but in a large for every ſacred rite commended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or gift and office of the Church. As for the word <hi>coeter is,</hi> the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> inſiſteth upon: it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth only a generical convenience and ſimilitude not a ſpecificall; and ſo wee acknowledge that there are many ſacred rites in the Church, which agree with Baptiſme and the Lords Supper in the genericall notion of Sacraments: but not in the ſpecificall as the word Sacrament is taken for a peculiar ſeale of the New Teſtament, having thereunto annexed a promiſe of juſtifying grace. Now let us weigh what the <hi>Knight</hi> alledgeth out of S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> for two Sacraments only,<note place="margin">De doct. Chriſ. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>

Auſtine</hi> out of himſelfe thoſe ſignes or Sacraments which here hee calls a few, in his 118. Epiſtle hee tearmes <hi>most few (Sacrament is numero pauciſsimis)</hi> ſurely ſeven Sacraments are not <hi>numero pauciſsima,</hi> feweſt in number, but two are ſo: and therefore in his booke <hi>De ſymbolo ad catechumenos,</hi> he tearmeth them <hi>gemina Eccleſiae ſacramenta;</hi> which paſſage the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> taketh no notice of, becauſe hee could give no anſwer at all unto it, yet hee ſetteth a good face upon the matter ſaying, this may ſuffice for ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as were alledged out of <hi>S.

                     <p>To the ninth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The authour of the treatiſe <hi>De ablutione pedum,</hi> who was farre later then <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> mentioneth indeed five ſacraments which are more then two, yet leſſe then ſeven, and for thoſe five hee nameth, it is evident hee intended not that they were Sacraments in a ſtrict ſenſe. For one of them is <hi>ablutio pedum,</hi> which if it bee a Sacrament in the proper ſenſe, then hath the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit</hi> an eighth ſacrament as himſelfe is <hi>ſapientum octavus. Not ſo,</hi> ſaith hee, for <hi>ablutio pedum</hi> which that Authour meaneth is the ſacrament of Penance.

                        </note> and therefore it may bee tearmed a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in a large ſenſe, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expoundeth that authour.

                        <hi>If I your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet.</hi> Yea but (ſaith <hi>Flood,</hi>) the authour ſpeaketh of another Laver after Baptiſme, and what can that bee other then Penance? He ſpeaketh of another <hi>laver,</hi> not of another <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which laver is no other then the laver of penitent teares.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154277:201"/>Sacraments mentioned by this Author, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth of the other three?

                     </p>
                     <p>To the tenth. The <hi>Ieſuit</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>S. Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> bewrayes extreame negligence. For the <hi>Knight</hi> quoting <hi>S. Iſidore</hi> at large in his ſixt book, and not naming any chapter, this <hi>Deſultorius Miles</hi> poſting through one chapter, and finding not the words there, chargeth the <hi>Knight</hi> with falſification; whereas in the chapter immediatly following, to wit, the 19. according to the later edition of <hi>S. Iſidore</hi> (but in the 18. according to the former) the teſtimonie alledged by the <hi>Knight</hi> is found in expreſſe words, and <hi>Baptiſme, Chriſme, and the Lords Supper reckoned by him for the Sacraments of the Church there,</hi> without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any other; If hee had held ſeven ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, queſtionleſſe in that place hee would have named all, or at leaſt the major part of them. The <hi>Ieſuit</hi> applieth a plaiſter to this ſore, to wit, that elſe-where the ſame Father mentioneth Penance
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154277:202"/>and Matrimonie. But the plaiſter is too narrow, and the ſalve of no vertue at all. Firſt, it is too narrow, for though Penance and Matrimonie be added to Baptiſme, Chriſme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we have yet but foure (or if we take Chriſme not for a Ceremonie uſed in Baptiſme but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Sacrament from it) at the moſt, but five: wee are ſtill out of our reckoning, wee heare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Order and Extreame Vnction. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the plaiſter is too narrow, ſo the ſalve ſpread on it is of no vertue at all. For though <hi>S. Iſidore</hi> compareth Penance to Baptifme in reſpect of the effect thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> waſhing away of ſinne, yet he maketh not thereby Penance a Sacrament. Whatſoever waſheth away ſinne is not therefore a Sacrament,<note place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> Faith <hi>purifieth the heart,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh;<note place="margin">Luk. 11.41.</note> and Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <hi>doe Almes, and all things ſhall bee cleane unto you;</hi> Yet doth it not from thence follow, that either Faith or Charitie are Sacraments.

Neither doth the <hi>Knight</hi> otherwayes urge it then as the ſingular opinion of a ſingularly learned <hi>Ieſuit</hi> enforced by evidence of truth, to give over
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154277:208"/>their chiefeſt hold of antiquitie in this point the authoritie of S. <hi>Auſtine.</hi> Well, be it ſo ſaith <hi>Flood, Vaſquez</hi> is ſo farre for you, yet <hi>we have an</hi> Oliver <hi>for a</hi> Rowland, Bellarmine <hi>for</hi> Vaſquez; <hi>for this opinion of</hi> Vaſquez, <hi>is contradicted by other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Divines, and by</hi> Bellarmine <hi>in particular.</hi> Where is then the unitie our Adverſaries ſo much bragge of? two of the greateſt Champions of the Pope <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſtrive about S. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and the one refelleth the reaſons of the other, ſo that it ſeemeth our popiſh Divines are as ill reſolved about the proofe of their doctrine, as I ſhewed before out of <hi>Canus,</hi> that they were in a wood concerning the doctrine it ſelfe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I adde, that though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may goe in <hi>equipage</hi> with <hi>Vaſquez:</hi> yet <hi>Vaſquez</hi> againſt them more diſparageth their cauſe, then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for them helpeth it. For a teſtimonie from an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is of more force for us, then the teſtimonie of a friend, or rather ſworne vaſſall to the Roman Church can be for them.</p>
                     <p>To the twentieth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Sithence ſignification is of the eſſence of the Sacrament, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will have this ſignification neceſſarily to <hi>containe in it three things, the Paſsion of Chriſt, ſanctifying grace, and eternall life.</hi> And whereas farther he confeſſeth <hi>that the ſignification of theſe three things is moſt apparant in Baptiſme and the Lords Supper.</hi> The <hi>Knight</hi> ſtrongly concludeth out of him that our doctrine concerning two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is more certaine and evident, then theirs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:154277:209"/>concerning ſeven, and conſequently that our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe is ſafer in this point then theirs. As for that which the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> addeth out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that the reſt of the Sacraments ſignifie all theſe things at leaſt <hi>implicitly</hi> were it true, yet wee had the better of the cauſe. For our two Sacraments, as it is confeſſed, ſignifie theſe things <hi>plainly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently;</hi> theirs obſcurely and <hi>implicitly;</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not true that they ſignifie or repreſent thoſe things at all. For what repreſentation is there betweene impoſition of hands in orders, or joyning of hands in Matrimonie, or confeſſing ſinnes in penance, or chriſme in Confirmation, or oylein Extreame Unction, and the Paſſion of Chriſt, and eternall life? What the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> addeth for concluſion, that the reſt of the <hi>Knights</hi> ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nothing but ſuch fooliſh ſtuffe as hee is wont to talke, without rime or reaſon, needeth no other anſwer then this that the <hi>Knight</hi> indeed from p. 157. to 161. taketh an inventorie of a great deale of fooliſh ſtuffe, but it is theirs, not the <hi>Knights,</hi> to wit, that <hi>Chriſt ſatisfied the people with five loaves and two fiſhes which make ſeven, and that which</hi> Andrew <hi>ſaid, there is a boy here which hath five loaves and two fiſhes, muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the ranke of S.</hi> Peters <hi>ſucceſſors,</hi>

                  <p>This was no new thing begun by that Councell,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but it being growne to bee a generall practiſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in one kind, which alſo from the beginning was ſomewhat practiſed, and certaine heretiques ariſing, and condemning the practiſe and beliefe of the whole Church; this Councell condemned them, and commanded the former cuſtome to bee ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>Though Chriſt did inſtitute the Sacrament in both kindes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> yet it is lawfull to receive in one: neither doth the Councell decree any thing againſt Chriſts Precept by eſtabliſhing the Communion in one kind, for Chriſt may inſtitute a thing without comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it.

For if whole Chriſt be received in either kind, why did Chriſt who doth nothing ſuperfluouſly, inſtitute the Sacrament in both kindes? If the Sacrament can no otherwiſe exhibit Chriſt unto us then by vertue of his Inſtitution, how can wee be aſſured that whole Chriſt is communicated unto us, when we violate his inſtitution adminiſtring the holy Communion but by halfes? the Sacrament exhibiteth nothing but what it ſignifieth, but the bread ſignifieth Chriſts body not his blood: the wine ſignifieth his blood, not his bodie; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accordingly the one exhibiteth only his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the other his bloud. Againe, if Chriſt bee whole in either kinde, then a man might receive whole Chriſt in drinking of the cup only, though he eate not at all of the bread, and conſequently a man may without ſinne at the Lords board drinke only of the Conſecrated cup, and not eate of the bread which yet no Papiſt to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ever durſt affirme.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:154277:215"/>Chriſt had not breathed on them, nor given them the power of remiſſion of ſinnes: next admit they were Prieſts, yet in the inſtitution of this Sacrament they were <hi>non conficients,</hi> ſupplying the place of meere communicants, and therefore conſequently whatſoever Chriſt commanded them, hee commanded all receivers after them.

For the maine ſcope of the <hi>Knight</hi> in this and other Sections is to prove the viſibilitie of our reformed Church in former ages by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Romiſh adverſaries: this hee doth in the point of the Communion in both kindes abundantly in this Section, and the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> cannot denie it; it followeth therefore that in this maine point of controverſie betweene us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wee have antiquitie, univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and eminent viſibilitie, and the Roman Church none of all: whereby any underſtanding reader may ſee that the <hi>Knight</hi> hath already wonne the day; Yet for the greater confuſion of the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> I adde that what the primitive Church did uniformly, they received it from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and what the Apoſtles did joyntly, no doubt they did by the direction of the holy Ghoſt, according to our Lords will: and ſo their example amounteth to a Precept.

For the Latine ſervice was generally underſtood in the Weſterne Church, and the Greeke in the Eaſterne; when and where it was not ſo generally underſtood they had their ſervice in their Mother-tongue, as namely among the Syrians, Armenians, Ruſſians, Egyptians, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians.

For Hebrew was then the vulgar tongue of the Iewes, and the Greeke to the Gentiles, yet wee find that neither the writing the Old Teſtament in the Hebrew, nor the New in the Greeke, which were then the vulgar languages to thoſe people, bred any contempt of ſacred things with prophaneſſe and irreligiouſneſſe, but the cleane contrarie effects. The uſe of Scripture in a vulgar tongue is not the cauſe why any diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme or undervalew it, but want of inſtruction in heavenly myſteries, and careleſſe and ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reading without ſearching into the bottome of the ſpirituall meaning, where Orient Pearles lie.

For though I grant that every devout ſoule ſo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the perſon of our Lord and Saviour, that ſhee loveth the very ground hee trod upon, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth thoſe languages above all other in which his titles were proclaimed, for the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his kingdome: yet the reaſon hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in our preſent caſe. For though a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den key bee ſimply better then a key of iron, yet a key of iron which will open to us a casket of moſt pretious Iewells, is better for that uſe then a key of gold which will not open the lock. Admit the originall languages of Greeke and Hebrew are ſimply perfecter, and better then any other which are derivatives from them, yet the Mother-tongue, or vulgar language, is better and fitter
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:154277:230"/>for the congregation in time of divine Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it anſwereth the <hi>wards of their underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>openeth</hi> to their capacity the Divine myſteries then celebrated, which the learned languages cannot doe.

To this inſolent interrogation of the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> wee anſwer, that in generall, prayer in an unknowne tongue is commanded in all thoſe texts of Scripture, which require us to come neere unto God, and pray unto him with our heart. For by the heart the underſtanding as well as the will and affections are meants, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that prayer of <hi>Solomon, Da mihi cor intelligens?</hi> in particular and expreſſe words it is commanded in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. chapter through the whole, out of which wee thus argue, if it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Church to ſpeake five words with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that by our voyce wee may teach others, then a thouſand words in an unknowne tongue: then certainly the publike Service of the Church ought to be in a knowne tongue; but it <hi>is better in the Church to ſpeake five words with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to inſtruct others thereby, then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand words in an unknowne tongue,</hi> v. 19. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publike Service of the Church ought to bee in a knowne tongue. If all things ought to be done in the Church to edification, then ought the publike Service to bee in a knowne tongue; (for <hi>hee that ſpeaketh in an unknowne tongue edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> v. 5.) but in the Church all <hi>things ought to bee done to edification,</hi> v. 26. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the publike Service ought to bee in a knowne tongue: If in the prayers of the Church the people are to joyne with the Prieſt, and teſtifie their conſent with him by ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to his prayers, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thankes: then ought the publike Service
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:154277:231"/>to be in a knowne tongue: But in the prayers of the Church, the people ought to joyne with the Prieſt, and teſtifie their <hi>conſent by ſaying Amen</hi> to his prayers, and giving of thankes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the publike Service ought to bee in a knowne tongue. If in the Church prayers wee ought to pray and ſing with underſtanding, then ought Church ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to bee in a knowne tongue (<hi>for if wee pray in an unknowne tongue our ſpirit prayeth, but our underſtanding is unfruitfull,</hi> v. 14.) But in the prayers of the Church wee ought to pray and ſing with underſtanding, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the publike Service ought to bee in a knowne tongue. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> ſhift off theſe paſſages with a wiſh, ſaying that S. <hi>Paul indeed adviſeth and wiſheth, that when any prayer is made in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, there ſhould bee ſome to interpret, but that hee requireth no ſuch thing to bee obſerved as a divine precept:</hi> for <hi>v.</hi> 37. hee addeth, <hi>if any man thinke himſelfe a prophet or ſpirituall, let him know that the things which I write unto you, are the commandements of God.</hi> To conclude, when S. <hi>Iames</hi> commandeth, <hi>that whoſoever prayeth,</hi>

Well <hi>Eſay</hi> propheſied of you hypocrites, <hi>this people honoureth mee with their lips, but their heart is farre from mee:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. where the Apoſtle profeſſedly diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt ſpeaking in the Church in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue. But the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> excepteth, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in that chapter condemneth not ſimply prayers in an unknowne tongue, though hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth prophecie. By which his ignorant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, it ſhould ſeeme that hee read that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in an unknowne tongue; for hee ſpeaketh ſo wide from the matter as if hee underſtood never a word in it. It is true that the Apoſtle in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comparing the gift of tongues, and prophecie together condemneth neither of them, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the gift of prophecie; and in proſecution of the compariſon falleth upon thoſe who uſed the gift of tongues in publike prayers in the Church, and hee expreſly condemneth that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of them, becauſe they that prayed in ſuch ſort uttering words that were not underſtood, <hi>ſpake not to men, becauſe no man underſtood them,</hi> v. 2. <hi>ſpake into the ayre,</hi> v. 5. <hi>edified. not by thoſe prayers,</hi> v. 12.17. becauſe others could not joyne with them in their prayers, nor <hi>ſay Amen to their thankes,</hi> v. 15.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:154277:233"/>for them. For who will not attribute more to the uniforme practiſe of the primitive Church, then to the heteroclyte practiſe of later Churches? aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly the practiſe of the primitive Church wherein the people anſwered the Prieſts, and not the Clarke only, is moſt agreeable to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and conſonant to reaſon. For publike prayers were inſtituted eſpecially for three ends, firſt, for the moſt ſolemne worſhip of God, when thouſands of hands are at once lifted up to him, and as many tongues confeſſe his name: ſecondly, for the ſtirring up of greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, when many hundreds praying and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſinging together, like ſo many coales on the ſame hearth kindle one the other, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the flame. Thirdly, for more prevalencie with God, when we <hi>offer violence,</hi> as it were to heaven, and ſend up our united devotions like a <hi>vollie of ſhotte to batter the walls of it;</hi> They who pray in a tongue which the people underſtand not, and therefore cannot joyne with them in their prayer, faile of all theſe ends. Yet to <hi>ſodder</hi> all, the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> beareth us in hand, that <hi>the Maſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame continually, the people underſtand it ſufficiently for the exerciſe of their devotion, though not to ſatisfie vaine curioſitie;</hi> which ſpeech of his is partly ſenceleſſe, and partly blaſphemous: it is ſenceleſſe to imagine that a man who never learned his Grammar, nor ever was taught Greek or Latine, by hearing onely the Maſſe read over, though a thouſand times ſhould come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:154277:233"/>it; ſecondly, it is blaſphemous to ſay that to deſire to underſtand the particular contents of the Epiſtles and Goſpels read in the Maſſe, or the pſalmes of <hi>David,</hi> ſung in the Church is vaine curiofitie, or hereticall pride. Loe here <hi>Flood</hi> his channell falleth againe into the Stygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an lake.</p>
                     <p>To the fourteenth. There is no contradiction at all in the <hi>Knights</hi> obſervations.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> For though this ſtory of the ſhepheards abuſing the words of Conſecration, and ſtrucke dead for it, might peradventure occaſion ſome alteration in thoſe Churches, where it was beleeved, yet there was no generall command for the practiſe of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Service, in all Chriſtian Churches before <hi>Vitalians</hi> time; who in the yeare 666. verified the number of the name of the beaſt in himſelfe, which according to the interpretation of S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> who flouriſhed within two hundred yeares after Chriſt, is <hi>lateinos,</hi> as before I noted. But for mine owne part I have no faith at all in that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendarie fable of the Sheepheards; Firſt becauſe thoſe that coyned it, agree not in their tale, for ſome ſay, that the Bread and Wine were tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into fleſh and bloud, and the ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards for their prophane abuſe ſtrucke dead: others tell it otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Caſſand. li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turg. c. <hi>28.</hi> Honorius in Gem. animae, Bellar. l. <hi>2.</hi> de Miſ. c. <hi>22.</hi>

For he loadeth the <hi>Knight</hi> with ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe calumnies, and moſt impudently defendeth ſuch groſſe idolattie as the wiſer of the heathen were aſhamed of: hee whetteth his poyſonous tooth, and like a mad dogge ſnaps at all hee mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with, and farre out-raileth <hi>Rabſekah</hi> himſelfe, as the Reader cannot but judge if hee peruſe but a few paſſages enſuing, namely firſt, <hi>page</hi> 298. <hi>This is your diſcourſe Sir</hi> Humphrey, <hi>wherein you have given ſo ſufficient teſtimonie of notorious had dealing, eſpecially in the two places of</hi> Euſebius, <hi>and of the civill law: that if there were nothing elſe falſified or corrupted in your whole booke, this were enough utterly to deface all memorie of you, from among honeſt men.</hi> And page 301. <hi>What ſay you to all this Sir</hi> Humphrey? <hi>looke now into your owne conſcience, and ſee whether it can flatter you ſo much, as to ſay you are an honeſt man.</hi> And page 205. <hi>May not you then beare away the bell from all lying, and corrupting fellowes that have ever gone before you?</hi> Hee that ſeeth ſuch foule ſtuffe come out of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> mouth, would hee not thinke that he were ſicke of the diſeaſe called <hi>miſerere?</hi> but I leave his Grobian language, and come to conſider firſt what hee laieth to the <hi>Knights</hi> charge, and after, how hee diſchargeth himſelfe of the idolatrie and ſuperſtition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Knight</hi> in this chapter burdeneth the Roman Church. Firſt, he chargeth the <hi>Knight</hi>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:154277:237"/>with falſe tranſlation, of the Councell of <hi>Trent. Wee teach that the image of Chriſt, the Virgin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, and other Saints are chiefly in Churches to be had, and reteined, which Decree he might have tranſlated a little better, and more clearely by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thoſe images are to bee had, and reteined eſpecially in Churches, the Latine word being</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertim, <hi>and his tranſlating it chiefly, and placing it ſo odly, gives cauſe to thinke he had an evill meaning therein, as if hee would have his reader thinke that the Councell taught that thoſe images were the chiefe things to be had in Churches, &amp;c.</hi> It is a ſigne of a light head to ſtumble at a ſtraw: yet here lyeth not ſo much as a ſtraw in the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> way: only he wanted a feſtrawe to point to the accent, which is ſet upon <hi>Churches</hi> not upon <hi>had,</hi> the meaning of the Councell and the <hi>Knights</hi> is all one, to wit, that images by that Decree were to bee had, and reteined chiefly or eſpecially in Churches, not to bee had or held to bee the chiefe thing in Churches. For no man would imagine that the Councell could bee ſo abſurd and impious, as to preferre images before the ſacred Scriptures, the Font and Chalice, the Altar or communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: much leſſe the ſacred Symbols of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud. Secondly, he chargeth the <hi>Knight</hi> with groſſe ignorance, in Chronologie, <hi>But I may aske you,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>how come you to ſay the Iewes never allowed adoration of Images for foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, when as the people of the Iewes were not ſuch a people above two thouſand yeares; nay</hi>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:154277:237"/>Moyſes <hi>lived not paſt</hi> 1500. <hi>yeares before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſo that of your owne liberalitie and skill in Chronologie you have added</hi> 2000. <hi>yeares to make your doctrine ſeeme ancient.</hi> There is a groſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake I confeſſe, but in the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> not in the <hi>Knight:</hi> who ſaith not 4000. yeares, but for <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi> 4000. yeares in the firſt edition, and in the later editions this ſcape of the preſſe is mended, and the figure altered. For the matter it ſelfe, the <hi>Knight</hi> might truly have ſaid, that the people of God, who lived partly under the law of nature, partly under the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> never allowed adoration of Images for 4000. yeares: ſo ancient is the doctrine of the reformed Churches in this point. Thirdly, he chargeth the <hi>Knight</hi> with Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing with Iewes in the hatred of Chriſt, <hi>You</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>in alledging the Iewes hate of the croſſe, as an argument why you ſhould alſo hate the ſame, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly confeſſe that you love Chriſt ſo well as they:</hi>

To ſtab the Kings picture, or any way deface it out of hatred, or contempt of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is diſloyaltie: yet to take a piece of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit coyne prohibited by law, though bearing the Kings image, and pricke it full of holes, or naile it to a poſt, is no argument of diſloyaltie, but contrarie, an act of Loyaltie, and obedience alſo to the Kings lawes.

                  <p>Chriſts Merits lying in ſtore for the need of all men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may be fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a common Treaſure, and be called by that name. So farre forth then as thoſe Pardons were grounded on Chriſts merits, or granted by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to the penitent, there is no difference betweene theirs and ours.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> forgave the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not onely in the perſon of Chriſt, but for their ſake alſo: which importeth, the prayer and deſerts of Saints to have ſome place in the beſtowing of that Indulgence; and ſo likewiſe, it was the practiſe of the Primitive Church: and what was this, but by applying the ſuperabundant merits in the one, to ſupply the want in the other?</p>
                  <p>That the merits of Martyrs were applied to others,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> appeareth by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who being become now an Heretike, did reprehend that cuſtome, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154277:259"/>that a Martyrs merits were little enough for himſelfe, without having any ſurpluſſage to helpe others withall.</p>
                  <p>Many a man continueth his great auſterity of Faſting,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Watching, Praying, and other exerciſes of all vertues, after hee hath obtained pardon for the fault it ſelfe, by hearty contrition and by humble confeſsion obtained alſo remiſsion of the temporall puniſhment, within the ſpace of <hi>1, 2, 3, 7, 10,</hi> or <hi>12</hi> yeares (for example ſake) hee then leading the ſame life for <hi>20, 30, 40, 50,</hi> or <hi>60</hi> yeares, as many have done; what ſhall become of all that ſatisfaction which is over and above, for that ſinne or ſinnes which hee committed before? It doth not periſh or paſſe without fruit, though not of him, yet of others: and if they be not applied preſently, why may they not then be ſaid to lye in <hi>depoſito,</hi> as money in a Treaſurie?</p>
                  <p>Sith all grant Indulgences for the living,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> why not for the dead, ſo long as they pertaine to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, and have need thereof?</p>
                  <p>The authority which the <hi>Knight</hi> citeth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> to make Indulgences applyed to the ſoules in Purgatorie to be ridiculous, out of the old Sarum booke of the houres of our Lady, doth not mention Purgatorie, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith, That whoſoever ſhall ſay theſe and theſe prayers, ſhall gaine ſo many thouſand yeares of pardon, which is no more for the dead than for the living.</p>
                  <p>It is falſe which the <hi>Knight</hi> averreth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> that wee give Pardons for thouſands of yeares in Purgatory
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154277:259"/>after death. For wee doe not ſo, neither doe wee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe Pardons, wherein are mentioned ſuch number of yeares ſo, as if men were without thoſe Pardons, to remaine ſo long in Purgatorie: but wee underſtand thoſe yeares according to the penitentiall Canons, by which, many yeares penance were due for one ſinne, and many mens ſinnes being both very grievous, and as a man may ſay, without number, according to the account of the ancient penitentiall Canons, they may ſoone amount to thouſands of yeares, which, though a man cannot live to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme here in this world, nor even in Purgatory, for the length of time; yet hee may in Purgatorie, in few yeares ſpace, nay, few months, or few weekes ſpace, ſuffer ſo much puniſhment as is anſwerable to all that penance of many thouſand of yeares, which a man ſhould have performed here, if hee could have lived ſo long.</p>

                  <p>It is intollerable preſiemption in the Knight to take upon him to cenſure ſo great a Councell as that of <hi>Trent.</hi>

                  <p>It is cleane a different thing to diſpute of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the <hi>Catholique</hi> faith which we maintaine,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and of every mans private and particular beliefe of his owne juſtification or ſalvation, which we deny to be ſo certaine: the one being grounded upon the authority of Gods divine truth, and revelation, the other upon humane knowledge, or rather conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Howſcever though we be not certaine by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of divine faith, that this or that man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is truely baptized or ordained a Prieſt; yet we are certaine by the certainty of divine faith, that not onely there be ſuch Sacraments, but that they are alſo truly adminiſtred in the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>It might be good and profitable as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> noteth, to invoke the Saints,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould not heare us, as the <hi>Knight</hi> would prove out of <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> and <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> who though they doubt of the manner, yet they doubt not of the thing it ſelfe; <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſaith, the Saints are invocated not as givers of the good things for which we pray, but as interceſſours to God the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

And as for Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> alleaged by the <hi>Knight</hi> to the contrary, his words are to be meant of the finall and eternall place of ſoules. For otherwiſe, Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> is ſo expreſſe for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, in the very booke and place quoted by the <hi>Knight,</hi> to wit, in his <hi>Enchiridian ad Laurentium,</hi> that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

The ſame Father elſwhere ſaith, The whole time betweene the death of a man, and the generall reſurrection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the ſoules in hidden receptacles, as each is worthy, either of eaſe or paine.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of Catholikes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> concerning worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, is not uncertaine, it being this onely, that Images are to be worſhipped, but not as Gods. For the ſecond Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> it requireth not onely kiſsing of Images, and a civill kind of imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, but a proſtration on the ground, and praying on the knees before them: <hi>Gregorie de Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> taketh the word <hi>Simulacrum,</hi> in a good ſenſe, and concludeth out of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that ſome Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip is lan full, not any Idoll worſhip, as the <hi>Knight</hi> impoſeth on him.</p>

For Faith, if it be divine, is founded upon Gods Word, not the Churches definition: if nothing be matter of Faith, before it be defined by your Church, then Tranſubſtantiation was no article of Faith,

To avoid theſe Rockes, if our Adverſaries will confine the

                  <p>There is no more fafety in the Proteſtant doctrine of Iuſtification, than the Romane.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> For Catholikes truſt wholy in God, attributing no more to their owne good workes, than that they cooperate to Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, meriting grace and glorie: and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Proteſtants teach vaine confidence in moſt of theſe points, as that a man muſt aſſure himſelfe that his ſinnes are forgiven, that hee muſt aſſure himſelfe of his ſalvation, and that he cannot fall from grace, and the like: which ground ſuppoſed, how can hee worke out his ſalvation with feare and trembling?</p>

                  <p>Though ſome Catholikes ſay, that there is more perfection of the Sacrament, which conſisteth in the repreſentation in both kinds, than in one; yet there is the ſame ſafety and fruit in one, and in both kinds.</p>

Howſoever, it is ſafer to follow the judgement of all other Doctours of the Catholike Church, all other Fathers and Councels teaching the contrarie; of all which, there is abundant proofe in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and which was never contradicted by any, but knowne wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Though publike Prayers in Latine may not be ſo profitable to the people,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> yet they are lawfull and ſafe, and the fruit of refection of the underſtanding by Prayer in a knowne tengue, whereof <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, will not countervaile the tenth part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience which may happen by having publike Prayers in a knowne tongue.

                  <p>There is no danger in worſhipping Images,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> or praying to Saints: and <hi>Eraſmus, Caſſander,</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> who teach the contrary, are of none authoritie.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> nor <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> contradict the Doctrine of the Romiſh Church in the point of Merit.

The Doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to wit, that it is moſt ſafe to truſt wholly in the Merits of Chriſt, is as well the Catholike Doctrine, as the Proteſtants: who condemne not Proteſtants for not truſting in their workes, or truſting wholly in Chriſt; if ſo be they deny not the neceſsitie and efficacie of good workes, for purchaſing grace and glorie.</p>

Secondly, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> with his Roman Councell, freely give their cenſure of all Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall bookes then extant, but they clip not the tongues of any Authors, nor burne their bookes. If the Romiſh Inquiſitors had done no more, if they had let the Records and Evidences remaine, and onely cenſured them at their pleaſure; wee would not ſo much have blamed them, for uſing the freedome of their judgements: wee would

                     <p>To the third. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his teſtimonie of the Romane Church, whereof hee was then Biſhop, can be of no great moment. It ſeemeth at that time,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wanted good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that the Pope was faine to <hi>blazon his owne armes, and guild his owne Dioceſe;</hi> not thinking of the old Proverbe, <hi>Laus propria ſordet in ore.</hi> Howbeit, wee grant in <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his time, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church had not <hi>many ſpots and wrinkles,</hi> for then ſhee was young in compariſon; now ſhe is <hi>old and decrepit, and all full of wrinkles: and after the manner of crooked old age, boweth downe,</hi> to wit, <hi>to rood-lofts, Images, and Pictures.</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then nor now, hath ſhee any power to forbid the uſe of any Books through the whole Church: but onely within her owne juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> This Plaiſter is a great deale too narrow for the Sore of the Romane Church, to which the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> applieth it. For it is not their admonitions to the Children of their owne Church, which we here complaine of; but their <hi>cutting out of the tongues of learned Authors, when they witneſſe the truth:</hi> not the cenſuring their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:154277:305"/>own Writers, but the mangling of ſome of them, and utterly aboliſhing others. Vnder colour of taking away <hi>Rats-bane out of the way,</hi> they take away <hi>Sugar</hi> from their Children; and which is worſe, debarre them from the <hi>ſincere Milke of the Word,</hi> I meane, the Scriptures in the vulgar language. Yet were there <hi>Rats-bane,</hi> in ſome of the Writers with whom the Inquiſitours have to deale, they ſhould have onely given notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or preſcribed ſome Antidote againſt it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Phyſitians, and Apothecaries, and Houſholders alſo, make good uſe of <hi>Rats-bane</hi> ſometimes.</p>
                     <p>To the fift.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The <hi>Ieſuit</hi> doth well, not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take juſtifying of the Inquiſition, which hee well knoweth hee is not able: onely here and there hee nibleth at ſome Author or other that hath falne into their hands, as <hi>Bertram</hi> in this place: whom the <hi>Knight</hi> long agoe reſcued, and gave unto him the <hi>wings of the Preſſe to flie abroad;</hi> whereby hee hath received no diſgrace, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thankes from all that <hi>love the Truth in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> For the tranſlation thereof, which the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> imputeth to the <hi>Knight,</hi> as a great diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to him; the truth is, the <hi>Knight</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated not <hi>Bertram,</hi> but publiſhed the tranſlation of another, by re-printing it, and gracing it with a learned and elegant Preface of his owne. Which, I marvell not that the <hi>Ieſuit kicketh</hi> at, becauſe hee and his fellow <hi>Ieſuits</hi> are <hi>ſore Galled</hi> with it.

Secondly, that ſuch bookes of Holy Scriptures are Canonicall, and the reſt which are knowne by the name of <hi>Apochrypha,</hi> are not Canonicall, is proved by arguments and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies drawne out of Scripture it ſelfe, by <hi>Whitaker, Diſputatione de ſacrâ Scripturâ, controverſiâ primâ;</hi> by <hi>Reynolds</hi> moſt copiouſly in his <hi>Cenſura librorum Apochryphorum.</hi> Thirdly, I retorte the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> argument againſt himſelfe, when they teach tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is part of Gods word, how prove they it to be ſo? by Scripture, or Tradition? by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they cannot prove, that unwritten traditions are Gods word: if they prove it by Tradition, then they begge the point in queſtion, and prove <hi>idem per idem.</hi>

Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith not, that thoſe things are <hi>hard to be underſtood</hi> ſimply, and to all men; but <hi>to the ignorant and unſtable, who wreſt all Scripture to their owne deſtruction.</hi> Among which number, the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> muſt reckon himſelfe and his aſſociates, before they can fit this text to their purpoſe.</p>

                        <hi>as might ſuffice for the ſalvation of all Beleevers.</hi> Neither is that text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> any whit derogatorie to the perfection of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for whatſoever hee meanes by Tradition <hi>(per Sermonem)</hi> taught by word of mouth, it is certaine out of the ſeventeenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that all Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech and diſcourſe to the <hi>Theſſaloinans,</hi> whereunto the words have

Thirdly, admit they were different things which hee ſpake to them, and which hee wrote: all that can be from thence inferred, is but this, that all points of ſaving Doctrine are not written in this Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> which may be granted without any prejudice to our Tenet.

                     <p>To the eight.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> This Proverb might moſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have beene applied to the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> in the former Section, when he, a <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> produced <hi>Oliverius Manerius</hi> a Jeſuit, againſt <hi>Henry Buxhorne,</hi> Deane

But it no way fitteth <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> and the <hi>Knight,</hi> the one being a zealous Proteſtant, the other a profeſſed Papiſt, though diſcovering, and ingeniouſly confeſſing divers abuſes in the Papacie. If hee were as the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> ſayes, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, becauſe hee wrote of Art-magicke; what were Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and <hi>Sylvester,</hi> who not onely ſtudied, but alſo practiſed the black-Art, as <hi>Benocardinalis, Platina,</hi> and others write.</p>
                     <p>To the ninth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The <hi>Ieſuit</hi> will not ſtand an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering every one ſeverally, becauſe hee dare not keepe that ſtation for feare of Gun-ſhot. For the anſwer hee giveth in generall, it is falſe and abſurd, if not impious: falſe, becauſe it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that thoſe ſimilitudes cannot be applied to the letter onely, without the meaning; nor doe the Heretikes now a dayes, nor did the Devill himſelfe alleage onely the letter and ſyllables of Scripture, but the meaning alſo,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16.</note> though perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and wreſting it to an evill end, and drawing falſe concluſions from it. Hee that calleth the Scriptures <hi>Sybils Prophecies</hi> blaſphemouſly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth at the obſcuritie of the meaning: and <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hius,</hi> who compared it to a noſe of wax, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taxeth the diverſitie of ſenſes, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which the Scripture is ſubject unto in it ſelfe. Laſtly, the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> taketh himſelfe by the <hi>noſe,</hi> in ſaying, Heretikes in all Controverſies run to the letter of the Scriptures, leaving the true

In the queſtion about the number of Sacraments, they alleage the letter of that text in the vulgar tranſlation, <hi>Hoc eſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Sacramentum,</hi> to prove marriage a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereas the Apoſtle in the ſame place ſaith, that hee ſpeaketh not of corporall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a man and his wife: but of the ſpirituall marriage of Chriſt and his Church. Likewiſe in the Controverſie about the reall preſence, they <hi>run to the letter, Except yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood:</hi> though Chriſt in the ſame place expounding himſelfe, ſaith, <hi>The words which I have ſpoken unto you, are ſpirit and life:</hi> the like may be obſerved in other Controverſies. For anſwer to all which texts, wee tell him out of Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> whom himſelfe quoteth in the next Paragraph; <hi>That the Goſpell conſiſteth not in the words of Scripture, but in the ſenſe: not in the ſuperſicies or barke, but in the pith: not in the leaves of ſpeech, but in the root of reaſon.</hi>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154277:316"/>water; and what affinitie the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> hath with the reſt of the ancient Heretikes, the <hi>Knight</hi> ſhewed him before in his ſeventh Section: and if hee deſire to know more of his pedegree from them, I referre him to an Appendix to <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> anſwer to <hi>Sanders</hi> his Demonſtration, <hi>page</hi> 801.

                     <p>To the eleventh.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> The Scripture is a <hi>Light, Pſal.</hi> 119. and the nature of a light is, firſt to diſcover it ſelfe, and then all things elſe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Calvin</hi> to his fond queſtion, how know you Scripture to be Scripture? anſwereth acutely by retortion, how know you the Sun to be the Sun? If hee ſay, by his bright luſtre and beames; wee ſay the ſame of holy Scripture, that it is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by its owne light. Which, if the Papiſts ſee hot, the fault ought not to be laid upon the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames, but upon their Owles eyes.</p>
                     <p>To the twelfth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> That rule which needeth any thing to be added to it, is imperfect: but all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts teach, that to the written Word unwritten Traditions muſt bee added to make a compleat and perfect rule of Faith: all Papiſts therefore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:154277:317"/>teach, the Scripture alone to be an imperfect Rule. We on the contrary ſtand for the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scripture, and conſtantly and unanimouſly defend that not onely the whole Scripture is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that every part alſo hath its owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but not the perfection of the whole. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the eyes have not the perfection of the whole head; or the head, the perfection of the whole body; a man cannot conclude, that the eye, or the head is imperfect: no more can the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit</hi> conclude that the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> or Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> are therefore imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe they containe not in them all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in particular neceſſary to ſalvation. It is ſufficient that they together with the reſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſtruct us in all points of faith: by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they perfectly informe us ſo farre as the Holy Ghoſt intendeth, that we ſhould be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by each of them in particular, and this is their perfection, that they have no defect in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or forme, and that they concurre with the reſt of the bookes of Scripture, to the maine end of the Holy Ghoſt in committing the word of God in writing, for the infallible and perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Church, and every faithfull ſoule in all Doctrines needfull to ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>To the thirteenth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Although many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have written <hi>de Scripturâ judice,</hi> and they have warrant our of Scripture ſo to ſtile it; <hi>(the words which I have ſpoken they ſhall judge you)</hi> yet in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech, which eſpecially ought to be

He ſaith indeede in that place, that it <hi>was but in vaine to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with a certaine kinde of Haeretikes by Scriptures alone, quia iſta haereſis non recipit quaſdam Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, et ſi recipit, non recipit integras et ſi aliquatenus integras praeſtat, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>This haereſie admits not of certaine Scriptures, or not intire, or if in ſome ſort in ire, it perverts them by diviſing divers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations.</hi> In which words he no way diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the holy Scriptures, or derogateth from their perfection: but diſcovereth the wicked practiſe of <hi>Haeretikes,</hi> and their evaſions and tergiverſations, when they are moſt evidently convinced by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                     <p>To the fifteenth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Though it were granted the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have written more upon the Scriptures then <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> it will not from thence follow, that they more reverence or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Scripture: ſithence in their very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon Scripture, they derrogate from the authority, ſufficiency, and perfection of them, by refuſing to referre all points of faith in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to their deciſion: by reſolving their faith laſt of all not into them, but into the Church: by teaching, that they are obſcure even in points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation; and that unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are equally to be reverenced with them. Secondly, compare men with men, and oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities with oportunities; it may eaſily be proved that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in their preaching, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings upon Scripture, have beene farre more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious then the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Name me one <hi>Papiſt</hi> who Preached ſo often, and wrote ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately upon the Holy Scriptures, as <hi>Calvin.</hi> I grant their bookes exceede in bulke and number, becauſe they have a hundred to one, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with leiſure, and meanes, having many thouſands maintained in their monaſteries, who are not charged as our Divines are, with care of ſoules, and perpetuall labours in their Paſtorall function.</p>

                     <p>To the firſt.

Biſhops that ſuffered Martyrdome under the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours within 300. yeares after Chriſt, held the ſame faith, and ſubſcribed to the ſame Articles of <hi>Trent;</hi> he would be ſtampt at, and hiſſed out by all preſent; for who knoweth not that <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> immediatly ſucceeded <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the moſt Orthodox Biſhop, and that all the <hi>Arian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in <hi>Conſtantius his</hi> time, held the Sees of thoſe Orthodox Biſhops, who in the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Nice</hi> condemned that blaſphemous haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.

                        <hi>and</hi> John? <hi>To ſay nothing of the reſt, it is manifeſt, that in</hi> Peter <hi>all the reſt are contained.</hi> This prayer then no more privilegeth the See of <hi>Rome</hi> from error, than of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> or of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or any other See of the Apoſtles.

Thirdly, Chriſts prayer is for <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe in his perſon, and the Apoſtles whom Satan winnowed, not for his See. Fourthly, if this promiſe any way belonged to his Succeſſors, certainly no more to thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> than <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia;</hi> ſo infirme is this the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> proofe, which yet hee ſaith, <hi>Muſt ſtand firme, till</hi> Sir Humphrey <hi>can tell what Pope began to varie from his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.</hi> Agreed: Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſhall preſently tell him by name, <hi>Liberius</hi> the <hi>Arrian, Vigilius</hi> the <hi>Eutychian, Honorius</hi> the <hi>Monothelite</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in three generall Councels ſixth, ſeventh, and eighth; <hi>Iohn</hi> the three and twenty, depoſed in the Councell at <hi>Conſtance:</hi> as for other enormous crimes, ſo for this his damnable hereſie, that <hi>Hee denied the immortalitie of the ſoule, and the life to come.</hi> To which, after the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> hath replied, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhall be given in many other Popes, which have beene branded with the note of hereſie in like manner.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>To the fourth. Not only Proteſtants, whom the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> nick-nameth <hi>Heretikes,</hi> but alſo <hi>Contius,</hi> and other Romaniſts have diſparaged theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: and if the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> noſe be not very <hi>flat, and ſtuffed</hi> alſo, hee may ſmell the forgerie of theſe Decretals by the barbariſme of the ſtile, diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to thoſe times,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and many abſurdities and contradictions noted in them by <hi>Coqueus</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>To the fift. If it be no matter of Faith, that this particular Prieſt Tranſubſtantiateth the Bread, becauſe no man knowes his intention, nor that particular Prieſt, <hi>Et ſic de caeteris:</hi> It followeth, that it is no matter of Faith to beleeve, that any Prieſt in the Roman Church, by the words of Conſecration, turneth the Bread into Chriſts Body. As for that, hee
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:154277:325" rendition="simple:additions"/>addeth, that it is no matter whether any ever died for this point in particular; I anſwer, it is a matter of great moment: for if <hi>Garnet</hi> would not take it upon his ſalvation, that this Bread hee conſecrated, immediately before the death, was turned into Chriſts Body; nor any ever would, or did pawne his life for Tranſubſtantiation: it is evident, that Papiſts themſelves doubt of the certainty of that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. On the contrarie, wee can produce hundreds, nay thouſands, who for denying Tranſubſtantiation, have beene put to death, and have ſigned the truth of the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with their blood: and therefore the Doctrine of the Proteſtants in this point, is of more credit than the contrarie, becauſe it is ſtrengthened and fortified by a <hi>Noble armie of Martyrs.</hi>

                     <p>To the firſt.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The words which the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> would make ſeem ſo ridiculous, are related by the <hi>Knight,</hi> as their owne words not ours, as any may perceive by the Preface to them, <hi>therefore ſay they,</hi> and by this that they are written in a leſſer Character, and is it not ſenſleſſe in the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> and moſt ridiculous to laugh at himſelfe, and put his owne nonſenſe upon the <hi>Knight,</hi> who taking the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> words as he found them, ſcorning to nible
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154277:338"/>at ſyllables, interpreted the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> words at the beſt, and taking his meaning, joynes iſſue with him upon the point in this manner. <q>In a Church profeſſing Chriſtianity, where the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament are received, and the two Sacraments inſtituted, by Chriſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, ſuppoſe we there to be two ſorts of Profeſſors, either publikely allowed as in <hi>France,</hi> or at leaſt tollerated, as in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, both theſe entituling themſelves to be members of the pure Orthodox Church, and neither of them having beene particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in any generall Councell, received through the Chriſtian world; the probleme then is, whether of theſe two, that party is not in the ſafer way, who holdeth no poſitive Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith, to which both parties (beſides all other Chriſtians) give not their aſſent unto: then the other who maintaineth twelve Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith at leaſt, wherein they themſelves ſtand ſingle, and are forſaken by all Chriſtians, not onely of the reformed Churches, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, Germany, Denmarke, Swethland, Norway, Poland, Tranſylvania,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches diſperſed through the large Dominions of the <hi>Turke</hi> in <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> But thus it ſtandeth betweene us and Papiſts, all the poſitive Articles which we hold neceſſary to ſalvation, they themſelves, and all other Chriſtian Churches in the world aſſent unto: whereunto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154277:339"/>many other poſitive Articles in joyning all under paine of damnation to beleeve them; in all which additions, ſhe ſtandeth alone by her ſelfe: therefore it is ſafer to adhere to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and faith of the reformed churches, then the Pope his new <hi>Trent</hi> Creed.</q> The <hi>Ieſuits</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt this argument are very idle, and all his inſtances in <hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Haeretikes,</hi> nothing to the purpoſe: for the unbeleeving <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> never were, nor yet are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholike Chriſtian Church: the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Neſtorians, Eutychians,</hi> and <hi>Marcionites</hi> have beene long agoe excluded out of the true Church of Chriſt, and their Haereſies are by name condemned in ancient generall Councells approved by the whole Chriſtian world. Theſe therefore come not within the verge of the <hi>Knights</hi> propoſition, which is reſtrained to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, and ſuch whoſe Tenets have not in particular as yet beene cryed downe, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as erroneous in any oecumenicall Councell: among ſuch, doubtleſſe thoſe are in the ſafer way, who hold nothing for an Article of faith neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation, which is not clearely deduced out of Holy Scripture, and aſſented unto, even by the oppoſite part, whoſe teſtimony, ſaith the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> Page 498. <hi>muſt needs proceede from evidence of truth.</hi>

                     <p>To the ſecond.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The <hi>Ieſuit</hi> hath received an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer already to the former of theſe demands, where I ſhewed by twenty inſtances that we
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:154277:339"/>ſtand not ſingle as they doe, by affirming what they deny, and denying what they affirme: for the moſt, if not all the affirmative Articles of our Creed, are firmed and ſubſcribed by Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereas their additionalls to them are fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by none but themſelves: and therefore herein our cauſe hath a great advantage on theirs.
